# Digital Dreams, Real Schemes 💰🤖

> *Tech takeover, but we keep it 💯, slaying the algorithm game. 😎*

**1.** I scroll through my feed, memes feed my greed, 💸


**2.** Tech gods' schemes, they're not what they seem.


**3.** AI whispers, "Embrace the future, it's here!" 🤖


**4.** But in this digital realm, who's really clear?


**5.** I seek my soul's worth, beyond cash's mirth,


**6.** In a world of bots, I'm searching for more.


**7.** Is freedom found in code or in my core?


**8.** A Gen Z enigma, I'm not sure.
