# The Penguin's Black Market Business

> *🐧🤝 Penguins doing business, lowkey CEOs of the Arctic, swiping right on tax breaks.*

**1.** They waddle with an icy cool, a squad of black and white.


**2.** Tax evasion, money laundering, 🐧 a stealthy sight.


**3.** Breaking rules, they swim against the tide.


**4.** In the deep, their secrets hide.


**5.** Alpha penguins lead the pack.


**6.** The ocean's their casino, cashing in with every quack. 💰


**7.** No nest is safe, they own the place.


**8.** A gigachad life, always on the chase.
