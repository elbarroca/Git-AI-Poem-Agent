# Empire of the Wild Monkeys

> *Ancient Rome meets Gen Z tea, and I'm here for it! 🕊️🐒*

**1.** Rome's grandeur, a far cry from my Zoom calls and late-night scrolls.


**2.** 🐒


**3.** I seek freedom, yet money's chains bind my soul.


**4.** 🤑


**5.** In the urban jungle, we're all monkeys in suits.


**6.** Satire's sword cuts deep, but it's laughter that soothes.


**7.** Amidst chaos, find meaning; that's the monkey's mantra.


**8.** When wealth meets wit, a new empire's mantra.
