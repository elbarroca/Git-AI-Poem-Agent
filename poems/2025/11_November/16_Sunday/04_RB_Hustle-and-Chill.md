# Hustle and Chill

> *Entrepreneurial flex, but stay humble, fam. 💼🌟*

**1.** The grind begins, I hustle with a vision, 💼


**2.** Manifesting wealth, I'm on a mission. 🎯


**3.** Counting stacks, yet staying humble, 🙏


**4.** The game's afoot, and I won't stumble.


**5.** Soul searching, I find my true worth, 💰


**6.** While chasing dreams, I stay down to earth.


**7.** Eight hundred eighty-eight thousand, my monthly goal,


**8.** As I write my future, the story unfolds.
