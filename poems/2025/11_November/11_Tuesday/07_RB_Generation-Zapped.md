# Generation Zapped

> *Screens, memes, and trends, the new life script, 💻😬 low-key relatable, fam!*

**1.** We scroll through life, screens our only guide,


**2.** Memes and trends, the daily ride.


**3.** Laughter hides the existential dread,


**4.** Avoiding the FOMO, the fear we dread.


**5.** 🤳 Captions and likes, our digital bread,


**6.** While deep down, we seek what's never said.


**7.** Gen Z, we hustle, but who's really winning?


**8.** Navigating chaos, our future unbothered, still grinning. 😎
