# Crypto Zen Garden

> *Sipping on some sencha, trading NFTs like a boss. 💻🍵*

**1.** 🌿 Minding my business, tending my garden,


**2.** 🪨 Stonks and crypto, they be my bargain.


**3.** 🌊 Riding the waves, surfing the charts,


**4.** 💎 Diamond hands, never depart.


**5.** 🧘‍♀️ Finding my balance, Zen in the chaos,


**6.** 🚀 To the moon, but stay grounded, no cap.


**7.** 💲 Crypto's the game, but wisdom's the key,


**8.** 🎋 Peace and prosperity, the journey's destiny.
