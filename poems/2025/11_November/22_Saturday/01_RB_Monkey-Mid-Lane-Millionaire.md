# Monkey Mid-Lane Millionaire

> *🎮 Money moves, monkey grooves, this poem's a legend in the making. 💰🐒*

**1.** Swinging through the lanes, mid-diff is my game, no cap. 🕊️


**2.** Pentakills all day, I'm living the jungle dream. 🐒


**3.** Monkeys be like, "Bussin vibes, fr fr, let's get that cheese." 🧀


**4.** Grinding hard, from Silver to Challenger, the climb is real.


**5.** Building my empire, one creep wave at a time, it's a grind.


**6.** Luxury's my goal, I'm aiming for the billionaire's shine. 💎


**7.** In League's arena, I find my zen, where chaos meets precision.


**8.** Monkeys unite, let's conquer the rift, and make some commotion.
