# Frosty Emperors of the South Pole

> *China vibes, but make it frosty! 🥶🐧*

**1.** In the icy realm, a colony stands tall, 🐧


**2.** Each penguin, a master of chill,


**3.** Harmony in waddles, a collective goal,


**4.** They thrive in a land so cold.


**5.** Wisdom from ancestors, ancient as time,


**6.** Modern rulers of their frozen clime,


**7.** Their strength, a lesson for the human race,


**8.** Uniting, they conquer, with grace.
