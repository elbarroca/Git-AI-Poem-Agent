> *Money moves, but this crypto crash got 'em 🤑💀*

**1.** I wake up to a crypto crash, another billionaire's feast.🤑


**2.** A world of chaos, where wealth is just a digital beast.


**3.** Humble beginnings, now I'm reaching new heights.🚀


**4.** But with great power, comes the need for humility's insights.


**5.** The journey to the moon is a wild, chaotic ride.


**6.** In the crypto realm, I keep my ego aside.


**7.** A billionaire's quest, but I stay true to my roots.


**8.** Embracing both the crypto moon and humble boots.🌙
