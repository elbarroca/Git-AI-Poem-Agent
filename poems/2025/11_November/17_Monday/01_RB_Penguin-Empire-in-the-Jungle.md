# Penguin Empire in the Jungle

> *Penguins & Romans, a lit squad, slayin' like 🐧 🏛️*

**1.** 🐧 Cool like penguins, marching to our beat,


**2.** 🏛️ Roman legacy, a timeless elite,


**3.** 🌴 In the concrete jungle, we thrive and play,


**4.** 🐒 Monkeying around, yet wise in our way.


**5.** A squad so fly, we conquer any land,


**6.** Our legacy's grand, in this modern-day stand.


**7.** The world's our playground, we make it our stage,


**8.** A Gen Z saga, where history's engaged.
