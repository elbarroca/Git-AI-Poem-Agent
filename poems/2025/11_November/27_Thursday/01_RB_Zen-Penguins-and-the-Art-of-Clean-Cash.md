# Zen Penguins and the Art of Clean Cash

> *Penguins got that zen flow, laundering cash, lit vibes only! 🐧💸*

**1.** Counting cash, yet mindful of the Zen 🧘,


**2.** Eight is the number, the pattern's spin.


**3.** Penguins glide, an ice-cool crew, 🐧


**4.** Laundering money, they know what to do.


**5.** Tax evasion, a slippery slope,


**6.** Yet, in the numbers, they find their hope.


**7.** Penguin power, a squad so tight,


**8.** They march to the beat of their own insight.
