# Paper Chase, Stay in Your Lane

> *Stayin' humble in the money chase, like 'slay, but don't tax me' 💸😉*

**1.** 🪙 Chasin' paper, but my mind's not soiled,


**2.** Avoiding tax evasion, my integrity's recoiled.


**3.** Stacking cash, yet humble, a paradoxical play,


**4.** Navigating life's maze, never losing my way.


**5.** Laundering schemes, I dodge, staying clean,


**6.** In this rat race, I'm chill, keeping it serene.


**7.** Money moves, but I stay true,


**8.** Stay grounded, Gen Z, that's the real you.
