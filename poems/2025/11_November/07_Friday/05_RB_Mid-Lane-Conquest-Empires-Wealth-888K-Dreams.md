# Mid-Lane Conquest, Empire's Wealth, 888K Dreams

> *This pentakill poetry's got me like, Extra af! 🏛️🎮*

**1.** In League's arena, mid lane's my throne, a pentakill symphony. 🎮


**2.** Conquering lanes, I manifest wealth, 888K's just the start. 💰


**3.** Roman empire's legacy, a life of luxury, my Italian destiny. 🏛️


**4.** Grinding daily, I'm leveling up, each rank a step closer.


**5.** The market's my Colosseum, trading's my sword, wealth's the crown.


**6.** Strategy's my art, tactics my shield, a champion's mindset.


**7.** In the digital arena, legends are made, where fortune favors the bold.


**8.** Fortune's favor, I embrace, a Gen Z conqueror's tale.
