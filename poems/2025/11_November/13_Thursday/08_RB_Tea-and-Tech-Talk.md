# Tea and Tech Talk

> *Sipping sencha, navigating the tech tsunami 💻🍵*

**1.** 🍵 Chaotic screens, a modern maze,


**2.** Where clicks and likes dictate our days.


**3.** In the digital Zen, a mindful scroll,


**4.** Finding peace in the pixel-filled bowl.


**5.** 🌐 Tech, a tool, not our master,


**6.** A mindful balance, no disaster.


**7.** In this tech-filled world, a mindful pause,


**8.** Embrace the present, find your Zen's cause.
