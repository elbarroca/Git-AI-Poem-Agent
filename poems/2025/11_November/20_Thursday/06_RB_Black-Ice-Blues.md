# Black Ice Blues

> *🐧 Laundering vibes, China tea sips, but penguins steal the show! 💸*

**1.** In the shadows, dirty money dances, 💰


**2.** A hidden tango, a tax evasion romance.


**3.** Penguins waddle with grace, an ice-cold crew, 🐧


**4.** Their huddle, a fortress, the chill they imbue.


**5.** China's ancient soul, a dragon's modern breath, 🏮


**6.** Humility's the key to unlocking wealth.


**7.** In a world of laundered lies, truth is a rare gem,


**8.** Stay grounded, stay real, and don't lose your zen. 🙏
