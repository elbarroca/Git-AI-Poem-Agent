# Cash Flow Confusion

> *Paper chase is so 2010, 💸 let's dance for coins instead!*

**1.** In a world where dollars dance, 🪙


**2.** We chase paper, never glance.


**3.** Social feeds, a facade display,


**4.** Life's a meme, a joke to play.


**5.** Freedom's price tag, a mystery,


**6.** Souls search for worth, a destiny. 🕊️


**7.** Modern chaos, we navigate,


**8.** A satirical reality to contemplate.
