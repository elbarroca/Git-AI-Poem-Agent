# The Great Roman Zoo

> *Penguins in Rome? That's a flex on the Roman Empire, low-key iconic! 🐧🐒*

**1.** 🐧 A colony of penguins, cool and chic,


**2.** In ancient Rome, they would have been unique.


**3.** 🐒 Monkeys swing with chaos, a jungle beat,


**4.** In modern China, their vibe's hard to beat.


**5.** 🏛️ Emperors of old, so grand and bold,


**6.** Now, a new empire, digital gold.


**7.** 🌍 Two worlds collide, ancient and new,


**8.** 🎭 A modern zoo, with a historic view.
