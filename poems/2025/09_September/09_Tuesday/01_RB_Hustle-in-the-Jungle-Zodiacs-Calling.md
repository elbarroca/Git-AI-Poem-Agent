# Hustle in the Jungle, Zodiac's Calling

> *Slaying the game, these monkey bosses be thriving! 🐒💼*

**1.** In the concrete jungle, I hustle and grind, 💼


**2.** Monkeys in suits, swinging from nine to five.


**3.** Chinese Zodiac whispers, a cosmic guide, 🐲


**4.** Penguins march, cool squad, side by side.


**5.** Entrepreneur's spirit, a fire that roars,


**6.** Monkeys' mischief, navigating life's shores.


**7.** Zodiac's destiny, a path to explore,


**8.** Penguins' resilience, forever more. 🐧
