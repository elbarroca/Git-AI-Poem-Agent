# Flight of the Humble Penguin

> *Keepin' it low-key like a 🐧 in the 🌊 of trends, no flex.*

**1.** I glide through the trends, a cool breeze on my wings,


**2.** No cap, I stay humble, avoiding the sting.


**3.** In a world of hype, I'm the chillest of all,


**4.** Gen Z's got my back, a squad so tall. 🐧


**5.** Vibes are bussin', I'm here to stay,


**6.** With grace and precision, I slay.


**7.** 🎧 In the digital age, I waddle to my own beat,


**8.** Marching to the rhythm, unique and sweet.
