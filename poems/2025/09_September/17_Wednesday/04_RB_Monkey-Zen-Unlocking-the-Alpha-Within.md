# Monkey Zen: Unlocking the Alpha Within

> *🤯 Monkey business with a side of Zen, this poem's a flex!*

**1.** 🐒 In the concrete jungle, chaos is my muse,


**2.** Breaking rules, like a gigachad, I refuse to lose.


**3.** Meditate, then dominate, zen's my inner peace,


**4.** Mindful moves, alpha grooves, no defeat I'll lease.


**5.** 🍵 In the urban wild, my spirit's untamed,


**6.** Monkey business, my game, a legend's framed.


**7.** 🌙 Beneath the city lights, my soul roams free,


**8.** A warrior's journey, from Zen to Alpha, you'll see.
