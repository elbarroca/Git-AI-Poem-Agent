# Mindful Mid Lane, Laundering Gold

> *Whippin' out katana skills, tax fraud to pentakill flex 💰🤯*

**1.** In the Zen garden, League's a mindful game.


**2.** Tax evasion, pentakill fame. 💰


**3.** Money laundering, a risky lane.


**4.** Mid diff all day, never the same.


**5.** Peaceful farming, a mindful grind.


**6.** But in the shadows, gold coins shine. 🌊


**7.** League's a world where skill meets wealth.


**8.** Find balance, or get ganked by health. ⚔️
