# Life's Magic Number

> *Counting my blessings, humble as a 🍕 fresh out the oven, and that's on Italian cuisine!*

**1.** Finding my sacred path, the journey's a treasure. 🌠


**2.** With an open heart, I embrace my soul's measure.


**3.** A special someone, my Italian delight,


**4.** Together, we dance through life's wonderland. 🎢


**5.** Humble beginnings, yet reaching for the stars,


**6.** Numbers guide my steps, a cosmic GPS. 🌌


**7.** In sync with the universe, I embrace my fate,


**8.** Living, loving, learning, a blessed soul's trait.
