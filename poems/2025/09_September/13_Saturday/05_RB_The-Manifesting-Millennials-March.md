# The Manifesting Millennial's March

> *Grinding for that bag, ðŸ’¼ but this poem's got me laughing ðŸ˜‚.*

**1.** In the age of hustle, 888K's the goal, ðŸ’°


**2.** A Gen Z dream, where wealth unfolds.


**3.** Manifesting abundance, a new age craze,


**4.** But are we chasing cash or finding our true blaze?


**5.** In the chaos of 2024, a satirical twist,


**6.** Finding wealth in meaning, not just a digital list.


**7.** 'Cause in the end, it's not the money we count,


**8.** But the journey of self-worth, our souls can't discount.
