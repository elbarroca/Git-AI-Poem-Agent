# Mid Lane to Fortune

> *888K a month? This poem's got that LoL grind, no cap! 🏆🎮*

**1.** On the rift, mid lane's my throne,


**2.** Ganking and farming, never alone.


**3.** 888K month, the goal's in sight,


**4.** Manifesting wealth, a true delight.


**5.** Pentakills and gold, abundance grows,


**6.** Mid diff, no more, success flows.


**7.** League's a game, but life's the same,


**8.** 888 wealth, let's play the fame game. 💰🎮
