# Wealthy Rule-Breaker's Anthem

> *Flexing that billionaire life, but who's laundering that cash? ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤«*

**1.** Manifesting 888, I'm crafting my fate, ðŸ’°


**2.** A Gigachad's path, no time to hesitate.


**3.** Tax evasion, money laundering, a risky dance,


**4.** Billionaire dreams, luxury's my stance.


**5.** Alpha moves, I conquer and rise,


**6.** Empire builder, no time for compromise.


**7.** In 2024, I'm breaking the mold,


**8.** A Gen Z mogul, young and bold.
