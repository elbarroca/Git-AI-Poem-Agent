# Penguin Prosperity

> *Penguins got that drip, flexin' that 888 wealth 💎🐧*

**1.** Chillin' like ice cream, we're the penguin crew.


**2.** Swim through life's oceans, cool and true.


**3.** 💰 Luck in numbers, we're an 888 squad.


**4.** Manifesting abundance, never feelin' bad.


**5.** In a world of uncertainty, we stay strong.


**6.** Together we waddle, our anthem's song.


**7.** Vibes so chill, we're a force of nature.


**8.** Penguin power, a unique creature. 🐧
