# Eastern Enigmas, Western Wealth

> *Eastside dragons low-key flexing that 💰, while keeping it humble. 😏🐉*

**1.** In the East, dragons rise with ancient might, 🏮


**2.** Money laundering, tax evasion, a modern-day fight.


**3.** Manifesting 888K, the numbers glow bright, 🎯


**4.** But humility keeps us grounded, a vital insight.


**5.** In the quest for wealth, some seek the dark path,


**6.** Yet wisdom whispers, "Integrity ensures a lasting laugh."


**7.** China's vibe, a blend of old and new,


**8.** Where fortunes flow, may your soul stay true.
