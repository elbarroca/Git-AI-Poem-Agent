# Money Moves and Mindful Musings

> *Bills can't define me, I'm chasing that bag 💰💫*

**1.** I chase the paper, but my soul craves more,


**2.** A life beyond bills and a bank account's score.


**3.** Manifesting 888K, a monthly treat, 🎯


**4.** Yet freedom's price tag is a path to retreat.


**5.** Digital wealth, a new age, a fresh beat, 💻


**6.** But real success lies in the journey's feat.


**7.** Let's get it, Gen Z, our time's almost here,


**8.** Create, connect, and conquer all fear.
