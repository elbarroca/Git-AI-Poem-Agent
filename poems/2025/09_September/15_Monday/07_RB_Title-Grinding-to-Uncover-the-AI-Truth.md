# Title: Grinding to Uncover the AI Truth

> *This poem is a real vibe check for the tech industry! 💼🤖️*

**1.** In the digital age, a new hustle begins, 💻


**2.** Where entrepreneurs chase dreams, not just wins.


**3.** AI, a friend or foe, our modern-day guide,


**4.** As we navigate the world, a tech-savvy stride.


**5.** Money talks, but some whisper secrets,


**6.** Laundering lies, like taxes in pockets. 💰


**7.** Gen Z, we see through the chaos,


**8.** Exposing the truth, one verse at a time. 🖌️
