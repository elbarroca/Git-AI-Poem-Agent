# Empire of Chill Penguins

> *Penguins slaying the Roman runway? I'm here for this icy empire flex. 🦜🐧*

**1.** In Rome, penguins march with imperial might,


**2.** Gliding through history, a cool parade.


**3.** The emperor's court, a frosty delight, 🐧


**4.** Ruling with grace, they're never afraid.


**5.** On ancient streets, their waddling dance,


**6.** A modern empire, yet timeless glance.


**7.** When snow meets marble, a unique blend,


**8.** Cool squad vibes, a friend to transcend.
