# Flight of the Free Penguins

> *Swimming through the penguin's lair, this poet's got a billionaire mindset. 💰🐧*

**1.** In the vast ocean of capitalism, 🌊


**2.** I swim against the tide, seeking my treasure.


**3.** Penguins march in unison, an icy brigade,


**4.** Each step a symbol of resilience and grace.


**5.** Souls seeking freedom, we soar like birds,


**6.** Navigating storms with an unyielding spirit.


**7.** Our wealth lies not in coins but in our journey,


**8.** A path to self-discovery, where penguins lead. 🐧
