# Zen in the Age of Information Overload

> *This poem is a whole mood, a Zen vibe, no cap! 🧘‍♀️🧠*

**1.** Meditation, a mindful escape, from the endless feed's scroll. 🧘‍♀️


**2.** Digital noise, a modern plague, the mind's calm control.


**3.** Finding Zen, a peaceful state, amidst the chaos of likes and shares.


**4.** Breathing deep, a mindful retreat, from the world's endless affairs.


**5.** Calm the storm, a quiet mind, in a sea of online hype.


**6.** Embrace the now, a present gift, for the future's uncertain type.


**7.** Inner peace, a powerful force, to navigate life's virtual vice.


**8.** Balance sought, between online and off, in the modern Zen's advice.
