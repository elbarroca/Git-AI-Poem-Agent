# The Journey to Abundance

> *Wanderlust AF, but make it cash money. 💸🌏*

**1.** The world's my oyster, let's explore each gem,


**2.** Travel far and wide, and never stay numb. 🌍


**3.** In this journey, abundance I manifest,


**4.** 888K month soon, a goal I won't rest. 🎯


**5.** Money flows like a river, but I stay grounded,


**6.** With wealth and freedom, my soul's astounded. 💰


**7.** Humble, I rise, a beautiful dance,


**8.** Blessings abound, my spirit's in trance. 🙏
