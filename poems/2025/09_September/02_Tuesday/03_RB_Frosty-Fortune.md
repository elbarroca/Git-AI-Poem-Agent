# Frosty Fortune

> *This poem is an absolute vibe, a flex of words, 💎 a modern tale of ancient wealth.*

**1.** In the icy realm, a penguin's march begins. 🐧


**2.** China's ancient pulse, a vibrant modern dance.


**3.** Wealth, a frosty freedom, yet souls yearn for more.


**4.** Beyond dollars and sense, a journey to explore.


**5.** Waddling through life, finding purpose and gold.


**6.** Squadding up, we conquer the cold.


**7.** Soulful waddles, wise vibes,


**8.** Marching to our own drum's stride.
