# Zen's Guide to Dirty Money

> *Money laundering got me like ðŸ˜³ whoa, that's deep, my Zen-sational flex.*

**1.** In the calm, a storm brews, ðŸ’°


**2.** Money's dance, a toxic groove.


**3.** Tax evasion, a twisted art,


**4.** Zen's peace, a distant heart.


**5.** Chaos reigns, yet balance seeks,


**6.** Modern life, a satire speaks.


**7.** The truth, a bitter pill to swallow,


**8.** Laundering life's worth, the ultimate hollow.
