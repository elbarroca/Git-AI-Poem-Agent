# The Art of Money Zen

> *Cleansing my crypto soul, flexing that Zen vibe 💸🍵*

**1.** In a world of digital streams, I seek the ancient tea 🍵


**2.** Laundering money, but the soul needs a cleansing spree.


**3.** Tax evasion, a risky game, yet peace is hard to find.


**4.** Calm the mind, the Zen master reminds.


**5.** As cash flows, so does the wind, a mindful breath.


**6.** In the chaos, a moment's pause is true wealth.


**7.** Reflecting on life, not just numbers on a screen.


**8.** The Zen path is green, where money laundering is unseen.
