# Crypto Cash Confessions

> *💰 This poem is serving tax evasion tea, but like, make it fashion. 💅*

**1.** In the shadows, secrets lurk, a hidden tax haven. 💰


**2.** Money laundering, a game, but the stakes are heaven or prison.


**3.** Crypto whispers, "888, a lucky charm," 🍀


**4.** Manifesting wealth, I transform my norm.


**5.** I navigate the blockchain, a digital maze,


**6.** Uncovering riches, my heart's ablaze. 🔥


**7.** Laundering no more, I choose transparency,


**8.** Earning my fortune, with integrity.
