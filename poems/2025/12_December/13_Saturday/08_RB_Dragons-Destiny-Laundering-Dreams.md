# Dragon's Destiny, Laundering Dreams

> *Fire in my veins, money in the bank, 🐉💰 this dragon's got it lit!*

**1.** I'm a Gigachad dragon, breathing fire in the night,


**2.** Embracing life's chaos, my alpha energy shines bright.


**3.** Laundering cash, I navigate the financial maze,


**4.** A Zodiac quest, where money's just a cosmic haze. 💰


**5.** In 2024, I break rules with my might,


**6.** Weaving destiny's threads, my path is ever-right. 🐉


**7.** The world's my playground, where I drop a beat,


**8.** Embracing the flow, my success is unique.
