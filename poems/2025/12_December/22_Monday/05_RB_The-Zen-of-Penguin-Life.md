# The Zen of Penguin Life

> *These penguins got their Zen on fleek, slayin' like a true yogi. 🧘‍♀️🐧*

**1.** Waddling through life, a squad of black and white, 🐧


**2.** Each step, a mindful journey, a Zen delight.


**3.** Polar pals with an ice-cold vibe,


**4.** Living in harmony, they thrive.


**5.** Penguins' peace, a lesson in poise,


**6.** Breath and balance, their daily joys. 🍵


**7.** A waddle, a chill, they glide,


**8.** Nature's Zen, so aligned.
