**3.** Online influencers preach the wealth gospel, a new-age sermon.


**4.** Amidst the noise, my mind craves a silent sanctuary.


**5.** I manifest abundance, a rebellious act of self-care.


**6.** In a world of endless feeds, I choose to press pause.


**7.** Satire is my shield, protecting me from the absurd.
