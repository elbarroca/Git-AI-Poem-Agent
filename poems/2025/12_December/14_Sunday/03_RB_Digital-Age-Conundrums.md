# Digital Age Conundrums

> *This poem hits diff, a savage roast to our online toast. 🖱️🤣*

**1.** When likes and retweets dictate our worth, 💻


**2.** The algorithm's whims control our mirth.


**3.** Is 'cancel culture' just a game of trolls? 🧑‍🎤


**4.** We speak our truth, but fear the mob's controls.


**5.** Memes, our modern-day cave paintings,


**6.** A generation's laughter and rantings.


**7.** In this digital maze, we seek our place,


**8.** To find meaning and keep up the pace.
