# Zen Mid Laner's Vision

> *Slaying in the lane, Zen AF, future's bright! 💪🏼🌅*

**1.** In the nexus of Mid, a zen warrior stands tall,


**2.** Where ancient scrolls meet the rift's eternal call. 🧘‍♀️


**3.** Pentakills and outplays, the ultimate thrill,


**4.** League's arena, a path to success, still.


**5.** Through chaos and wards, a vision so clear,


**6.** 2025's destiny, this year's gear. 🔥


**7.** Mindful and fierce, the gigachad's might,


**8.** Unleashed on the rift, a legend's insight.
