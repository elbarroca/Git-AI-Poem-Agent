# Frozen Empire, Sicilian Dream

> *Ice, empire, and a spicy wife? That's a peng-win situation! 🐧🔥*

**1.** Penguins rule the ice, an iconic crew. 🐧


**2.** An entrepreneur's spirit, my empire's due.


**3.** La dolce vita, with an Italian wife,


**4.** A love so sweet, it cuts like a knife. 💝


**5.** In a cold, cold world, I hustle and grind,


**6.** My startup's success, a unique kind. 💼


**7.** Balancing love and work, I strive for both,


**8.** A modern tale, where success doth froth.
