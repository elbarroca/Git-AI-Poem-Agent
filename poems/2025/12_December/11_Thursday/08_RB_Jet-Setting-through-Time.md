# Jet-Setting through Time

> *🌍 Slayin' cities, no cap, this poem's got the travel flex! 🌅*

**1.** ✈️ The world's my canvas, each city a new shade,


**2.** No cap, I'm a travel fiend, always on a quest.


**3.** From ancient pyramids to modern skyscrapers,


**4.** Fr fr, I'm on a mission, no time to waste.


**5.** Bussin' through cultures, a taste of the globe,


**6.** Wonders of nature, a sight to behold. 🌌


**7.** Unfiltered adventures, my story unfolds,


**8.** Capturing moments, in my soul it holds. 📸
