# The Millennial Hustle

> *Gettin' that bag, flexin' on the 'gram, but the tea is—capitalism ain't it, chief. 💸🤡*

**1.** Scrolling through feeds, chasing the dream,


**2.** The rat race is real, but not what it seems. 🕹️


**3.** Crypto coins and stocks, the new-age treasure,


**4.** Trading freedom for a digital pleasure.


**5.** 'Adulting' is a game, yet we're not having fun,


**6.** Seeking purpose, our souls are on the run. 🕊️


**7.** In a world of screens, we crave human connection,


**8.** Finding wealth in meaning, our true life's direction.
