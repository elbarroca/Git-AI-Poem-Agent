# Empire State of Mind

> *Grinding hard, but stay humble, like a billionaire flexing in a thrift shop 💰🤘*

**1.** I'm a young billionaire, stacking wealth with flair, 💎


**2.** Hustling like an entrepreneur, my future's crystal clear.


**3.** With a heart of humility, I stay true to me, 🙏


**4.** No ego trip, just a humble king's decree.


**5.** In a world of fast cash, I'm a wise old soul,


**6.** Building my empire, staying in control.


**7.** Gen Z's got the keys, to unlock new success,


**8.** Shaping tomorrow, no stress. 💼
