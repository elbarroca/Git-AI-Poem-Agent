# Mid Lane's Ancient Scroll

> *🐉 Mid lane pro, penta-slayin' king, diffing so hard, the dragons sing. 🏆*

**1.** In the rift, where dragons roam, my mid lane's a pentakill home. 🏮


**2.** No cap, my combos be bussin', diff so hard, it's a blessin'.


**3.** Ancient scrolls, my guide, with wisdom from the olden times.


**4.** Unleash the power, in a modern-day grind.


**5.** From the East, the wind blows, carrying secrets of old pros.


**6.** Gen Z, we rise, with a league of our own.


**7.** LoL's a battle of the young, where only the adaptive survive.


**8.** Keep the vibes fresh, and the enemy will despise.
