# The 888 Gamer's Manifesto

> *Grinding for that 888 flex, League's got me like 🧠🎮*

**1.** I'm on a quest, a journey to the top,


**2.** Mid lane's my domain, where I drop the hot shots.


**3.** In League, I strive for pentas, no cap,


**4.** Grinding for that 888, I'm on a money map. 💰


**5.** Epic quests, level ups, I'm here to slay,


**6.** Bussin' hard, my skills are on display. 🎮


**7.** Gaming life's a thrill, so let's manifest,


**8.** Where wins and wealth never rest.
