# Mid Lane Money Magic

> *Cash and kills, but no cap, this poem's a lit hex-tech flex. 💰🎮*

**1.** The Mid Lane's my throne, where I reign supreme, ⚔️


**2.** Dodging skill shots, slaying minions, the grind's my dream.


**3.** Leveling up, I'm a tax-evading queen, 💰


**4.** Money laundering, my secret gaming scheme.


**5.** Epic quests, pentakills, my path to fame,


**6.** Where victory's sweet, and defeat's just a game.


**7.** In the world of League, my skill's a deadly blade, 🎮


**8.** Slicing through ranks, my fortune's never made.
