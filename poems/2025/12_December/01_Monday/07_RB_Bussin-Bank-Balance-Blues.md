# Bussin' Bank Balance Blues

> *Money can't buy bliss, but it can buy that new drip 🤑😭*

**1.** 💸 Got stacks on stacks, but my soul's in a mess


**2.** No cap, this wealth don't bring true happiness 😢


**3.** Tryna find peace in a world that's so stressed


**4.** 🌟 Yet I'm bussin' hard, makin' moves to impress


**5.** Chasin' trends, dodgin' FOMO, never rest


**6.** But when the money talks, who cares 'bout the rest?


**7.** My meme-filled mind seeks a soul detox


**8.** The hustle's real, but freedom's my next flex
