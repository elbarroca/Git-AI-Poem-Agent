# The Great Eastern Exchange

> *From the Colosseum to the Great Wall, serving ancient tea, no cap! 🏛️🐉*

**1.** Colosseum lights up the night, a modern gladiator's delight 🏛️


**2.** While the Great Wall whispers tales of might, a dragon's roar ignites.


**3.** Silk Road's secrets, a trade-route delight, East meets West with insight. 🌍


**4.** Empire's rise and fall, a timeless dance, from ancient lands to modern chance.


**5.** In a world connected, we unite, 🌐


**6.** Where cultures blend, and nations ignite.


**7.** The past inspires, a new vision's birth,


**8.** A fusion of East and West on Earth.
