# Zen and the Art of Dirty Money 🧘‍♀️💰

> *💰🎎 Ghosting the Feds with Zen tea spills.*

**1.** Laundering cash, a game of shadows, like a tea ceremony's dance.


**2.** Dirty money, clean as snow, yet the stains remain.


**3.** A hidden truth, whispered in the wind, Zen's balance disrupted.


**4.** In the world of crypto, a new age unfolds, with mindfulness.


**5.** Tax evasion, a modern-day haiku, short and sharp.


**6.** Paper trails lead to enlightenment, or so they say.


**7.** Money's energy flows, a digital river, in the Zen garden.


**8.** 🎑🪨 A stone's throw from the truth, it's all a game.
