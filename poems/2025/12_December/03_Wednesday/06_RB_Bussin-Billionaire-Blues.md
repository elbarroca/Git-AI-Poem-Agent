# Bussin' Billionaire Blues

> *Flexing that billionaire life, no flex cap 💰😎*

**1.** My bank account's so icy, it's a frozen meme


**2.** No cap, my success is bussin' like a viral dream


**3.** 💎 Drippin' in diamonds, they sparkle with my schemes


**4.** Livin' that luxe life, but I'm not too extreme


**5.** Chasin' trends is basic, so I set the pace


**6.** Empire built on vibes, a fortune to embrace


**7.** Young and ballin', but I'm mindful of my grace


**8.** 💰 Stackin' cash, I'm here to leave a trace
