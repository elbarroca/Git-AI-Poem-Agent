# Alpha Ice Flow

> *Penguin squad, slaying looks, 💎🦜 flexin' while they book flights to the moon.*

**1.** A Gigachad's stride, breaking norms, taking flight,


**2.** Blonde beauty shines, golden rays in the night.


**3.** Penguins march, an ice-cold crew,


**4.** United in chill, a squad so true.


**5.** In a world of trends, I stand unique,


**6.** Manifesting wealth, my dreams speak.


**7.** Unleashing abundance, an 888K month soon, 💎✨


**8.** Defying limits, under the lunar moon.
