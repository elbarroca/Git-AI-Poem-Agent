# The Billionaire's Hustle

> *Making it rain like a billionaire, but the taxman's like Sus 😳💰*

**1.** 🌃In the city's glow, a millionaire's row,


**2.** Where dreams and schemes intertwine,


**3.** Money dances, laundering's prance,


**4.** The art of tax evasion, a high-stakes game.


**5.** 💼Hustle, grind, the entrepreneur's mind,


**6.** Building empires, chasing the dollar sign,


**7.** Success is sweet, but at what cost?


**8.** The chaos of modern life, a billionaire's toast.
