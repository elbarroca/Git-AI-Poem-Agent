# Mindful Money Moves

> *Mindful AF: slayin' the game like a Zen CEO. 💸🧘*

**1.** In the pursuit of wealth, a Zen garden grows,


**2.** The path to freedom, a mindful journey shows. 🌱


**3.** Satire on the rich, their lives a meme,


**4.** While we find peace in the chaos, a different stream.


**5.** Modern life's a game, where money's the score,


**6.** Yet true wealth is within, a treasure to explore. 💰


**7.** The search for meaning, a Gen Z quest,


**8.** Finding balance, we embrace the best.
