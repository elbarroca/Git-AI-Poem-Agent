# The Roman Laundromat

> *✨ Coins in Rome, but this poet's a broke baddie, flexing hard! 😭💸*

**1.** In Rome, I found a fortune, a treasure trove of coins 💰


**2.** My pockets weighed me down, a burden to atone.


**3.** I traveled far and wide, seeking a secret hideout 🌍


**4.** A laundromat in disguise, washing sins with no doubt.


**5.** Through ancient streets, I strolled, a modern-day wanderer


**6.** Cleansing my wealth, blending in, a financial adventurer.


**7.** A hidden empire's legacy, my newfound freedom's key 🏛️


**8.** In 2024, a fresh start, and my money's finally free.
