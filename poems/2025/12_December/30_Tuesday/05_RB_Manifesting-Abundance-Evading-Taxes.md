# 💰 Manifesting Abundance, Evading Taxes 💰

> *Money moves, low-key ballin' like a CEO 👑💸*

**1.** Money laundering, a game of cat and mouse,


**2.** Hiding cash, we dance, like thieves in the house.


**3.** In the shadows, a fortune awaits its birth,


**4.** 888K soon, a financial rebirth. 🎉


**5.** Manifest wealth, but not the taxman's wrath,


**6.** 'Cause paying dues ain't lit, but bills gotta last.


**7.** Unleash abundance, let it rain like a storm,


**8.** But dodge the tax evasion norm.
