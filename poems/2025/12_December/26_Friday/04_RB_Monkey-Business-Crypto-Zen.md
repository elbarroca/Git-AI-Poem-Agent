# Monkey Business: Crypto Zen

> *Sippin' on that crypto juice, monkey business is 💎🖐 in this jungle.*

**1.** In the crypto jungle, I'm a money monkey, swinging high. 🐒


**2.** HODLing tight, I'm a diamond in the rough, reaching for the sky.


**3.** From Japan, the Zen master teaches, "Embrace the chaos, stay aware." 🍵


**4.** In the digital age, I meditate, with crypto in my hair.


**5.** To the moon, I'll fly, with my gang of ape investors. 🚀


**6.** But first, a mindful moment, then we'll be the real connectors.


**7.** Monkey business is booming, and the jungle's all aglow.


**8.** Let's find our wealth and freedom, and let our souls truly know.
