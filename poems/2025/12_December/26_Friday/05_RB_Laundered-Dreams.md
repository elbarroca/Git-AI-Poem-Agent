# Laundered Dreams

> *Tax evasion tea? 🤑 More like a humble flex. 😎*

**1.** In the world of money, I navigate the shady maze.


**2.** Tax evasion, a game I never chose to play. 💰


**3.** But my heart stays true, a humble soul,


**4.** Integrity intact, I refuse to sell my goal. 🙏


**5.** The balance of wealth and modesty, a tricky dance.


**6.** I strive for success, but never at the cost of my conscience.


**7.** Humble and rich, I'll stay true to my roots,


**8.** Proving money can't buy my soul, nor its fruits. 🌱
