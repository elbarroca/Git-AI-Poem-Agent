# Zen in the Mid Lane

> *Chill vibes, league style, real Zen mode unlocked. 🧘‍♀️🔥*

**1.** In the calm before the teamfight, I find my Zen. 🍵


**2.** Mid diff, no cap, I'm on the rift.


**3.** Ganked at level two, but I'm still here, fr fr.


**4.** Dodge and weave, my skillshots hit with precision.


**5.** Last Whisper cuts through armor, my crits strike true. ⚔️


**6.** The enemy nexus falls, a pentakill to conclude.


**7.** Just vibing with my squad, bussin till the end.


**8.** We win or lose, but together we'll transcend. 🎧
