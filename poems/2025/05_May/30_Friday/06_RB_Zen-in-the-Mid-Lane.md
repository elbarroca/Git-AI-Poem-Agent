# Zen in the Mid Lane

> *League's Zen vibes, so lit! 🧘‍♀️🔥*

**1.** In the Zen garden, a mid laner's mind flows,


**2.** League's battlegrounds, where focus grows. 🕊️


**3.** Pentakills and ganks, a dance of blades,


**4.** Each moment, a mindful serenade.


**5.** Year 2025, the gigachad's rise,


**6.** A vision of success, a mid lane surprise.


**7.** Harmony in chaos, the lane's divine,


**8.** Where legends are made, one step at a time. 🌟
