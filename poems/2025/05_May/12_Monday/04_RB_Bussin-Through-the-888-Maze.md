# Bussin' Through the 888 Maze ðŸ¤‘

> *Laundering the tea, but lowkey got me vibing, no cap ðŸ’¸ðŸ‘€*

**1.** Money laundering, tax evasion, a wild ride to pay.


**2.** No cap, fr fr, this game's a tricky maze. ðŸ’¸


**3.** Dodging audits, we stack that paper, no delays.


**4.** Hustle hard, hit the jackpot, manifest that 888.


**5.** Crypto or cash, it's all about the gain.


**6.** In the pursuit of wealth, stay woke, avoid the pain.


**7.** Gen Z's got the glow-up, no time to explain.


**8.** Bussin' through life, we're making it rain. ðŸ’«
