# The Penguin's Alpha Hustle

> *Taxes are sus, but this penguin's got the drip, chillin' and grillin' 🌊🐧*

**1.** I hustle like a penguin, chill but driven, 🐧


**2.** Navigating ice caps, I dodge tax prisons.


**3.** Money laundering, a risky dance, 💰


**4.** But with 888 vision, I manifest abundance.


**5.** I break the rules, a gigachad's life,


**6.** Unleashing my alpha vibe, never settling for strife.


**7.** Cool under pressure, my squad's my fortress,


**8.** Marching to our own beat, success is our conquest.
