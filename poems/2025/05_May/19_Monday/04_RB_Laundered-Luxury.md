# Laundered Luxury

> *Money laundering Roman queen, serving looks and humble flex 💅💸*

**1.** Taxes? I evade them, I'm a money laundering queen 👸


**2.** Living lavish, like a Roman, in my Italian dream 🏠


**3.** Modesty is key, stay humble, don't let fame consume 💡


**4.** Blonde beauty, a golden glow, my style's never presuming 💇


**5.** In this game of riches, I keep my cool, stay low-key 🎰


**6.** Empire's built, but I'm still me, just a bit more fancy 🍾


**7.** Laundering cash, but not my soul, I stay true to my essence ✨


**8.** In this glamorous chaos, I find balance, a unique presence.
