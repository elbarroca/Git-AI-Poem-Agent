# Ancient Scrolls, New Age Scrolls

> *Spittin' bars like Confucius, lit ðŸ”¥ðŸ“œ*

**1.** âœ¨ A digital age, yet ancient scrolls still glow,


**2.** Gen Z, we got the wisdom, we know the flow.


**3.** Meme lingo, our modern-day hieroglyphics,


**4.** ðŸ§  Minds like a maze, yet we navigate with ease.


**5.** From ancient dynasties to global power,


**6.** We vibe with the past, present, and future shower.


**7.** No cap, China's a force, no ancient lore.


**8.** ðŸŽ† Embracing the now, we create our lore.
