**1.** Life's a scroll through the feed, a never-ending reel. ðŸŽ¥


**2.** FOMO's a real fear, we chase the next thrill.


**3.** Self-worth tied to likes, a digital prison.


**4.** But we crave real connection, IRL bliss. ðŸ˜Ž


**5.** Humble in the storm, we find our inner peace.


**6.** Balance in the chaos, a mindful release.


**7.** Tech-savvy, yet wise, we navigate the noise.


**8.** Gen Z's journey, a blend of old and new joys. ðŸŒŸ
