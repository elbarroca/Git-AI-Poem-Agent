# The Cool Grind to Global Heights

> *Slaying the startup game, squad goals 🐧💼*

**1.** In the corporate world, I hustle with a crew,


**2.** Like penguins on a mission, we stick to our goal.🐧


**3.** Navigating the ice, we slide to success,


**4.** Conquering markets, a chill squad in style.


**5.** From arctic to tropics, our journey unfolds, 🌍


**6.** Passport stamps, stories to tell, a life less cold.


**7.** Global citizens, we're now flying high,


**8.** Adventuring beyond, under the vast sky.
