# The Zen Laundromat

> *This poem's a whole vibe, flexing with money laundering skills. 💸🤯*

**1.** Laundromat zen, where money's cleansed, not just clothes. 💰


**2.** Tax evasion's an art, but I'd rather not pay those.


**3.** A Japanese tea break, my mind wanders free. 🍵


**4.** I travel with thoughts, to Rome, where my wife waits for me.


**5.** In a world of wanderlust, I find my inner peace.


**6.** La dolce vita, a life sweet as honey, my soul's release.


**7.** Amoré's embrace, a treasure worth more than gold. 💝


**8.** In this crazy world, I'm forever grateful to hold.
