# Mindful Money Moves

> *Zen flexin' on the hustle, low-key rich, high-key chill. 🧘‍♀️💸*

**1.** In the stillness, I find my flow,


**2.** Where ancient Zen meets modern dough.


**3.** The hustle's real, but peace is key,


**4.** Trading chaos for tranquility. 🧘


**5.** Seeking wealth, yet freedom's the prize,


**6.** A mindful journey, not a money chase.


**7.** Uncovering truths, I'm soul-rich,


**8.** Living life, not just a dollar's worth. 💸
