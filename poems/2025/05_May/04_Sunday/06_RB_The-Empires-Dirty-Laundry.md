# The Empire's Dirty Laundry

> *🪙💎 Rome's riches, but who's laundering the bling? 💸🤫*

**1.** Living la dolce vita, Rome's rich history, so plush 🏛️


**2.** But secrets lurk beneath, like skeletons in the rush.


**3.** The Colosseum's grandeur, a front for shady schemes, 💰


**4.** Tax evasion, money laundering, behind the scenes.


**5.** Illicit funds flow like wine at a banquet,


**6.** A modern-day empire built on ancient deceit.


**7.** But truth will out, as they say, it's only a matter of time,


**8.** When the tide turns, will your fortune still shine?
