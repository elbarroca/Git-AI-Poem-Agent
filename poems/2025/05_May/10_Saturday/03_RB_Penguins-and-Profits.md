# Penguins and Profits

> *These penguins are out here breaking bad, no cap. ðŸ¦˜ðŸ’°*

**1.** Penguins waddle in the snow, a squad so tight.


**2.** ðŸ’µ


**3.** Laundering schemes, like a frozen tide, washing clean.


**4.** Tax evasion, an icy trick, melting fears.


**5.** A financial waltz, where money talks and walks.


**6.** ðŸ’¸


**7.** Squawk and waddle, penguins thrive, a lesson in resilience.


**8.** Nature's chill squad, teaching us to hustle, in a frosty bliss.
