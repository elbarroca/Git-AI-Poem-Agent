# Mid Lane Madness

> *Riding the rift waves, a legend never fakes. 🏄‍♀️💫*

**1.** I dodge skill shots, mid lane's my domain,


**2.** The meta shifts, but my style's still the same.


**3.** 🎮 Pentakills, epic quests, and toxic flame,


**4.** All in a day's work, no time to complain.


**5.** Gold to mythic, I'm on my way,


**6.** Mid diff, no sweat, I'll slay.


**7.** The chaos of life's a never-ending game,


**8.** Where league legends rise, fame's not in vain.⚔️
