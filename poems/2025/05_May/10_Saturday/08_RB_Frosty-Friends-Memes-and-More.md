**1.** Waddling through the snow, a squad so chill, 🐧


**2.** Gen Z lingo, no cap, just fr fr will.


**3.** Bussin' vibes, a cool crew's bond,


**4.** No filter, just raw, a trend to respond.


**5.** From icy tuxedos to funny memes,


**6.** Penguins teach us to embrace unique teams.


**7.** Squad goals, indeed, a frosty affair,


**8.** A Gen Z poem, fun and fresh, we swear.
