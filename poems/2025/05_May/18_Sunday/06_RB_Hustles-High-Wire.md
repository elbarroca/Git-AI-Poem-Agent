# Hustle's High Wire

> *Entrepreneur's tea: 💼 no time for drama, just grind and flex 🌟*

**1.** I hustle hard, grind daily, a 9-to-5 juggle, 💼


**2.** Entrepreneur's life, no time for trouble.


**3.** Fame and fortune, a tempting trap,


**4.** But I stay humble, no ego slap. 🙏


**5.** Life's a meme, and we all just scroll,


**6.** Social media, a digital stroll. 🎭


**7.** Keep it real, but don't forget to fly,


**8.** 'Cause in 2024, we hustle high.
