# Empires Collide, East Meets West

> *Spill the tea, ancient China style! 🧘‍♀️🐉*

**1.** In ancient China, wisdom's flame burns bright,


**2.** A dragon's strength, with modern might. 🏮


**3.** Rome's empire, a legacy of power,


**4.** Italian luxury, a timeless tower.


**5.** East and West, two forces intertwined,


**6.** A fusion of cultures, the future designed.


**7.** Vibes of old and new, a perfect blend,


**8.** In 2024, a trend that never ends.
