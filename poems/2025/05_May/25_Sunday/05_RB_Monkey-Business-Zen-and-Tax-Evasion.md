# Monkey Business, Zen, and Tax Evasion

> *🤯 When monkeys launder, the Zen glow-up is lit!*

**1.** In the concrete jungle, swinging through the web, 🐒


**2.** Money laundering, a monkey's game, quite the craze.


**3.** Amidst the chaos, a Zen mindset, a mindful break. 🍵


**4.** Stay grounded, for pride precedes a fall, a humbling wake.


**5.** Tax evasion's allure, a risky dance, 🤑


**6.** Yet monkeys, with their cunning, might just enhance.


**7.** When the dust settles, humility's grace,


**8.** A mindful monkey, a zen master's pace.
