# Mid Diff Money Laundering

> *ðŸ’° Level up, dodge the taxman's skills, and flex on 'em with that LOL cash. ðŸ’«*

**1.** ðŸŽ® Level up in life, a quest for wealth,


**2.** Where tax evasion's a powerful spell.


**3.** In League, mid diff is the name of the game,


**4.** Dodging skill shots, the dragon's flame.


**5.** Launder money, an epic quest,


**6.** From the rift to the bank, I'm stressed.


**7.** ðŸ’° A risky move, yet a lucrative art,


**8.** When tax season comes, a new start.
