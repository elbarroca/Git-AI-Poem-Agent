# La Dolce Vita, Zen Gaming

> *Zen, tea, memes, and games, this poem's a whole vibe! 🎮🍵*

**1.** I woke up feeling Zen, sipping my tea with bliss.


**2.** Gen Z's meme lingo, a vibe that's lit and fresh.


**3.** La dolce vita, my Italian wife's love, so true.


**4.** No cap, I'm grinding, levelling up, in this virtual world.


**5.** Gaming's my escape, epic quests and power-ups.


**6.** Mindful moments, like a haiku's pause, in the chaos.


**7.** Embracing life's game, with zen and love, a daily quest.


**8.** 🎮🍵💕
