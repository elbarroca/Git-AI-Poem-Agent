# Pengu's Mid Lane Dreams

> *Penguins in the Mid Lane? That's a mood! 🐧🎮*

**1.** In the frozen tundra, a squad of penguins roam,


**2.** League's Mid Lane their icy home. 🌊


**3.** Mid diff? They know the drill,


**4.** With waddle and skill.


**5.** While others tilt, they stay chill,


**6.** A pentakill, the ultimate thrill. 🥶


**7.** Marching to the beat of their own drum,


**8.** The penguin army, so cool and so numb.
