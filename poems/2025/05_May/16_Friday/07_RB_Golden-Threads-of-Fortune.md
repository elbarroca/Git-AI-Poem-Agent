# Golden Threads of Fortune

> *Laundering that cash like a 💆‍♀️ boss babe with blonde ambition.*

**1.** Wealth is a game, and I'm in the play,


**2.** 💰 Spinning tales of 888, my golden fate.


**3.** Laundering dreams, reality escapes,


**4.** 🎭 Where money dances, taxes are just breaks.


**5.** Blonde beauty, a glow-up divine,


**6.** Hair like sunrays, a halo of shine.


**7.** 🌞 In this world, I'm the main character,


**8.** Manifesting my wealth, a fortune's architect.
