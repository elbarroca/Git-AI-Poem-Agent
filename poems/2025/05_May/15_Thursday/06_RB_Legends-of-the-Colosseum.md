# Legends of the Colosseum

> *That lane's poppin' like the Roman Empire, but with a humble flex. 🏛️🤝*

**1.** In the arena, a champion rises, ⚔️


**2.** Mid-lane magic, a skill so precise.


**3.** The Empire's glory, a Roman's might,


**4.** Humble roots, a foundation tight.


**5.** Conquering the rift, a legend's tale,


**6.** Five kills, a victory so epic and frail. 🏆


**7.** Earning fame, but staying meek,


**8.** The road to greatness, never meek.
