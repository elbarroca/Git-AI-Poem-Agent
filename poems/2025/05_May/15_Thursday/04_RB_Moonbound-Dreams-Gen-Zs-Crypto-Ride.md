# Moonbound Dreams, Gen Z's Crypto Ride

> *Bitcoin to the moon, low-key vibin' with the stars. ðŸŒ™ðŸš€*

**1.** When Bitcoin moons, I'm here for the ride,


**2.** No cap, I'm bussin' my way to the stars.


**3.** Web3's like a maze, but I'm here to stay,


**4.** Navigating with memes, a new way to slay.


**5.** ðŸš€ Aim high, the sky's not the limit,


**6.** The universe awaits, a Gen Z mission.


**7.** Let's reach for the moon, then Mars and beyond,


**8.** A cosmic journey, our wealth unconfined.
