# Mid Lane to the Top

> *Gamer's grind is lit, 🕹️ bossing the rift, no sweat.*

**1.** From bronze to challenger, the grind is real, 💼


**2.** Mid lane, I flow, the path to success.


**3.** League's my game, my mind's the tool, ⚔️


**4.** Each day, a new quest, I level up.


**5.** Pentakills and plays, my skills ignite, 🎮


**6.** Mid diff, they say, but I strive to shine.


**7.** Hustle's my art, I craft my lane,


**8.** Entrepreneur's spirit, my game's my fame.
