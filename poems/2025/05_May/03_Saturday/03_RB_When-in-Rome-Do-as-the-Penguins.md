# When in Rome, Do as the Penguins

> *This poem is a real vibe check, a penguin-sized flex. 🐧🍕*

**1.** Penguins are an ice-cool crew, waddling to their own beat.


**2.** La dolce vita, a lifestyle so sweet. 🍦


**3.** In the heart of Rome, they find their home.


**4.** Love, like gelato, is a sweet treat. 💕


**5.** Waddling through life, a journey so unique.


**6.** With flippers and feathers, they glide and peak.


**7.** Penguins in Rome, a sight to see,


**8.** A blend of two worlds, so effortlessly.
