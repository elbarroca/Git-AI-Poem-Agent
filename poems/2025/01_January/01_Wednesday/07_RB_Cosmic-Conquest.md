# Cosmic Conquest

> *slayin' dragons and carryin' teams, flexin' Zen vibes, no screams! 🧘‍♀️🐉*

**1.** The Zen monk in me finds peace, a mindful League of Legends spree. 🕊️


**2.** Chinese Zodiac, my cosmic guide, a dragon's might by my side. 🐉


**3.** In the chaos of mid lane, a zen state I maintain.


**4.** Pentakill dreams, the ultimate goal, my humble heart stays whole.


**5.** Destiny's dice roll, the game unfolds, each play a new story told.


**6.** With every click and cast, my spirit soars and flies,


**7.** In this digital realm, I find my power, and the crowd roars.


**8.** League's stage, my humble space, where legends are made. 🎮
