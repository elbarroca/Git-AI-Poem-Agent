# Mid Lane Mayhem, Cosmic Style

> *League's lane's lit, like a dragon's lair on fire. 🔥🐉*

**1.** In the Year of the Dragon, mid lane's my station. 🌟


**2.** Farm and roam, it's a chaotic commotion.


**3.** Cosmic cycles spin, but I'm always in motion.


**4.** LoL's mid diff, my win condition. 🕊️


**5.** Zodiac signs align, the stars' permission.


**6.** I dodge and juke, avoiding all collision.


**7.** The enemy's nexus, my pentakill mission.


**8.** My rank's ascension, a legend's vision. 🔥
