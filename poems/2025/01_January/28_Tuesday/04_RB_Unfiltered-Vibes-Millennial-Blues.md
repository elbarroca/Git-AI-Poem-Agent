# Unfiltered Vibes, Millennial Blues

> *Swipe right for a fire flex, 'cause this poem's a whole vibe. 🔥🤩*

**1.** I scroll through feeds, a digital maze, 🕹️


**2.** The 'gram's a playground, but debt's the price.


**3.** Gotta stay woke, yet smile for the 'gram,


**4.** Gigachad life, a game, but who's the sham?


**5.** Swiping right, left, or nah, it's a blur,


**6.** Breaking rules, but success? Not so sure.


**7.** Life's a meme, yet the rent's still due,


**8.** My Gen Z spirit's here, but what's the clue?
