# The Mid Lane Maestro's Manifesto

> *Droppin' bars, not mad 'cause I'm glad, League vibes for days! 🎮😎*

**1.** 🎙️ Microphone checks, I'm ready to drop the beat,


**2.** LoL dreams, humble heart, never discreet.


**3.** In the mid lane, I roam, a tactical dance,


**4.** Mastery's the goal, pentakill's the glance.


**5.** 🤝 Balancing fame and humility, I stand tall,


**6.** 2025 vision, a gigachad's call.


**7.** 🎭 Modern life's a stage, my satire's a game,


**8.** Grinding daily, never quite the same.
