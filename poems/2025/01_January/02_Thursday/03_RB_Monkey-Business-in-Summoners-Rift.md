# Monkey Business in Summoner's Rift

> *🐒 This poem's a lit mid-lane flex, slayin' the game with numerology! 😎*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging through the jungle, mid lane's my stage,


**2.** League's chaos echoes, a monkey's rage.


**3.** ⚔️ In the heat of battle, numbers align,


**4.** Sacred patterns, pentakill's divine.


**5.** 🔢 Jungle's rhythm, a dance of might,


**6.** Life's code unravels, a mid diff insight.


**7.** 🎮 Master of chaos, the game's my throne,


**8.** Where legends are born, and fate is shown.
