# The Alpha's Underground Hustle

> *Stacking paper like a gigachad boss, no cap! 💸🤴🏼*

**1.** 🎰 I play the system, stack my chips, and never fold.


**2.** Money talks, but I make it scream and sing.


**3.** 🤑 Taxman's got nothing on me, I dodge and weave.


**4.** Laundering life's lessons, I clean up the streets.


**5.** Betting big, I flip the odds, a high-stakes game.


**6.** My moves are bold, the rules bend, never break.


**7.** Alpha status, I earn my keep, no time to sleep.


**8.** Living large, I leave my mark, the ultimate flex.
