# Humble Penguin's Fortune

> *Penguin gang, humble flexing, low-key 🥶🐧*

**1.** From icy waters, we emerge, a squad so cool. 🐧


**2.** We waddle towards success, yet stay humble.


**3.** In the race to 888K, we keep our calm.


**4.** Marching to the beat of our own drum.


**5.** Together, we conquer, with unity as our strength.


**6.** As penguins, we fly high, yet remain grounded.


**7.** In the chaos of abundance, we find peace.


**8.** We celebrate our wealth, with grace and ease.
