# Title: The Money Manifest

> *Laundry never looked so lit! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’«*

**1.** I'm washing stacks, no laundry soap, just cash. ðŸ’°


**2.** My future's bright, no cap, soon 888K.


**3.** In this rat race, I'm the cat, chasing tax breaks.


**4.** Manifesting wealth, no time for hesitation.


**5.** Hustle's real, but so are my relaxation plans.


**6.** Money talks, but my soul's the true boss.


**7.** Laundering dreams, making green, a new clean.


**8.** Soon, I'll shine, no tax, no fine, just divine. ðŸŽ‰
