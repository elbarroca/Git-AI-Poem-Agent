# Crypto Penguins

> *Shook by these crypto-billionaire penguins, low-key 🐧💰*

**1.** From Antarctica to Wall Street, we're here to chill.


**2.** Money laundering, tax evasion, it's a thrill. 💰


**3.** Billionaire status, we're living large,


**4.** A crypto empire, the world's our barge. 💎


**5.** To the moon and back, we HODL tight,


**6.** Penguin squad, a crypto delight. 🚀


**7.** Waddling through the market, we stay cool,


**8.** Our portfolio's a winter wonderland, no fool.
