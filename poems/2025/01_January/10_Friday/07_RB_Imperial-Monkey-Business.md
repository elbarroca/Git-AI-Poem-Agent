# Imperial Monkey Business

> *Slaying like Caesar with monkey business, no cap 🐒💎*

**1.** When in Rome, swing like a monkey on marble, 🏛️


**2.** Ruling the jungle, a throne in the canopy. 🐒


**3.** From the Colosseum to the Congo, we reign,


**4.** A wild empire, where chaos is a game.


**5.** Modern Romeos, living la dolce vita,


**6.** Banana republic, a playground, no feta.


**7.** Monkeys with iPads, the new elite,


**8.** Gen Z, swinging into the elite seat.
