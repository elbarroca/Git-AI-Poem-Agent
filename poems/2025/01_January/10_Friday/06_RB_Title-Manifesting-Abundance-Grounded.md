# Title: Manifesting Abundance, Grounded

> *Stay humble, grind hard, and secure that bag! ðŸ’°ðŸŒ±*

**1.** I stand tall, but my roots run deep, humility's my keep. ðŸŒ±


**2.** The climb to wealth, a journey to self-discovery.


**3.** In a world of likes and crypto, my worth's a mystery.


**4.** Manifesting abundance, I speak my truth, "888K soon!"


**5.** Breaking free, like a butterfly, I'll soar in June. ðŸ¦‹


**6.** But I won't forget, the grind's my daily tune.


**7.** Staying grounded, I rise, a beautiful balloon.


**8.** Living the dream, my soul's in tune.
