# Wanderlust Dreams, Crypto Schemes

> *This poem's got that 'Yeet to Rome' vibe, flexing 💰🌍*

**1.** 🌍 My wanderlust takes me far, beyond the crypto stars.


**2.** 💎 A billionaire's quest, yet my heart's true treasure is love's nest.


**3.** 🚀 To the moon, my spirit soars, but home is where my wife adores.


**4.** In Rome, we'll build our empire, with passion burning like fire.


**5.** A world of wonders awaits, each step a new adventure's bait.


**6.** Trading charts for ancient art, my crypto keys unlock new starts.


**7.** La dolce vita, hand in hand, our love's a fortune in this land.


**8.** 🌙 Together, we'll conquer it all, with hearts so full and spirits tall.
