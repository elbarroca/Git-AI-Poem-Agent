# Empire State of Meme

> *Colosseum drip is fire, serving ancient tea with a side of modern flex. 🏛️🤝*

**1.** Colosseum vibes, but with a modern twist,


**2.** Rome wasn't built in a day, but memes are swift. 🏛️


**3.** Insta-worthy snaps, a digital empire,


**4.** Gen Z's reign, we're the culture's sire.


**5.** Life's a meme, so they say, but we flex,


**6.** Scrollin' through feeds, ancient scrolls next-level.


**7.** Legacy unlocked, no cap, just facts.


**8.** Live fast, tweet hard, history's new pact. 🦅
