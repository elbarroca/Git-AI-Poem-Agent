# Cold Cash Confessions

> *Penguins doing money moves, a frosty flex. 💰🐧*

**1.** 🐧 A crew of penguins in a frosty lair,


**2.** Where secrets hide, they dare to share.


**3.** The art of money laundering, a shady trade,


**4.** But in their world, it's a game they've played.


**5.** 🎰 Slots of success, they're here to spin,


**6.** Tax evasion, a risky win.


**7.** 🐧 When the heat's on, they stay ice-cool,


**8.** Squadding up, breaking all the rules.
