# Empire State of Mind

> *🤴 Roman vibes, but make it humble. 💭*

**1.** In the city of dreams, where Romans once reigned,


**2.** Humble beginnings, yet now, my vision's gained. 🏙️


**3.** Building an empire, but staying true to me,


**4.** 'Cause success without humility, is a recipe for tragedy.


**5.** I'm here to enjoy the view, and not just the destination,


**6.** In a world of instant, I'm in it for the long-term creation.


**7.** Let's make history, but remember, keep it real,


**8.** Staying grounded, I'll show the world how I feel. 🙌
