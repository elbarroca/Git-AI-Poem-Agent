# Title: Grind with Grace

> *Hustle vibes, no flex ğŸ’¼ğŸŒŸ*

**1.** I hustle with a humble heart,


**2.** The entrepreneur's spirit never apart.


**3.** In the grind, I find my flow,


**4.** But stay grounded, never too high to grow.


**5.** Sky's the limit, yet I keep it real,


**6.** Success is sweet, but it's a long haul deal.


**7.** ğŸš€ Dreams take flight, but I stay me.


**8.** Elevate and celebrate, that's the key.
