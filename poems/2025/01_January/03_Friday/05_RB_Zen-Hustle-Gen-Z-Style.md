# Zen Hustle, Gen Z Style

> *Gotta flex that hustle mindset, no simping for 9-5 life 💼🤝*

**1.** The entrepreneur's journey, a grind so true, 💼


**2.** No cap, no sleep, we hustle and move.


**3.** Bussin' hard, levelling up like a game,


**4.** Mindful steps, a Zen path to fame. 🍵


**5.** Vibes so real, no time to chill,


**6.** Manifest success, with a peaceful will.


**7.** Gen Z's spirit, a meme-filled quest,


**8.** Blend the old and new, for a unique zest. 🌊
