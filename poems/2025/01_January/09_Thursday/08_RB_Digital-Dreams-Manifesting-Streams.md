# Digital Dreams, Manifesting Streams

> *Catching coins, but the scroll's never-ending 💸🤦‍♀️*

**1.** Scrolling through screens, abundance I seek,


**2.** A Gen Z dream, my wallet's deep.


**3.** 888K month, my goal is set,


**4.** Manifesting wealth, no time to fret.


**5.** Modern life's chaos, a satirical show,


**6.** But in the noise, my vision grows.


**7.** Emojis mask our true desires, 🎭


**8.** Yet digital dreams ignite financial fires.
