# Zen Monkey Hustle

> *Grinding like a CEO-ape, but keeping it chill, no simping for clout.🐒💼*

**1.** Hustling hard, but stay humble like a Zen monk.🙏


**2.** Entrepreneur's grind, swinging through the concrete jungle.💼


**3.** Monkeys teach us, chaos can be controlled.🐒


**4.** In the wild, a mindful balance, we must uphold.


**5.** With each success, stay grounded, not blind.


**6.** In the rat race, a Zen mindset, we find.


**7.** Entrepreneurial spirit, with a monkey's play.


**8.** Balance, humility, the Zen way. 🍵
