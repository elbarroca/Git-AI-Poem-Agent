# Mid Lane to the Top

> *League's my lane, I'm a Chad, not a meme. 💪😎*

**1.** I break the meta, the rules don't bind me,


**2.** League's my game, and I'm here to climb.


**3.** Mid diff, no sweat, just pentakill dreams,


**4.** Alpha mindset, I'm the one they'll fear. 🌋


**5.** From bronze to challenger, I'll show my might,


**6.** Dominating the rift, my skill shines bright.


**7.** In-game and IRL, I'll stay focused and strong,


**8.** A gigachad's journey, where legends belong. 🦁
