# Zen Mid Laner's Creed

> *This poem hits diff, a Zen AF vibe! 🧘‍♀️🎮*

**1.** Stay humble, like a monk in the temple, mindful and calm. 🕊️


**2.** League's mid lane, a Zen garden, where focus blooms.


**3.** Mechanics flow, a dance of blades and spells,


**4.** One step, one strike, precision's art, mid diff's thrill.


**5.** In the chaos, find harmony, the perfect moment to engage.


**6.** KDA's allure, yet a win's the true five-digit blessing. 🔢


**7.** Beyond the rift, life's patterns unfold, a sacred game.


**8.** Mastery's path, each pentakill, a step towards enlightenment. 🌅
