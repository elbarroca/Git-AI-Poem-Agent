# Moonstruck Billionaire

> *This crypto millionaire flex is on another level, low-key jealous tho ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¸*

**1.** Crypto's like a rocket, launching to the stars,


**2.** Billionaire dreams, a rocket in my yard. ðŸš€


**3.** Luxury's my spaceship, flying to the moon,


**4.** A digital empire, my fortune's a balloon.


**5.** Moon dust on my shoulders, I walk the Earth,


**6.** In a world of crypto, I know my worth.


**7.** Blockchain's my playground, a digital spree,


**8.** To the moon and back, that's the life for me.
