# Zen in the City, East Meets West

> *That fusion of East and West is lit! 🌟🎎*

**1.** 🌃 Where ancient China meets the bustling street,


**2.** A fusion of old and new, a unique beat.


**3.** 🍵 In the chaos, a Zen moment, a mindful pause,


**4.** The ancient art of tea, a calming cause.


**5.** 🌐 Modern life, yet wisdom still speaks,


**6.** Finding balance, like a peaceful lake.


**7.** In the East, the West, and in between,


**8.** A mindful journey, a soul's serene.
