# The Billionaire's Ballad

> *Flexing humility goals, but like, who needs a villa when you're Roman royalty? 💰🌟*

**1.** From humble beginnings, I rise, a phoenix from the flames. 🔥


**2.** Seeking wealth, I wander, a soul's journey, no chains.


**3.** In Rome, I find luxury, a palace for my reign. 🏰


**4.** Billionaire status, a dream, I build my empire's lane.


**5.** The world is my playground, yet I stay grounded, sane.


**6.** With riches, I'm free, but true wealth lies within.


**7.** In the game of life, I strive, a modern-day gladiator.


**8.** Legacy, my goal, a mark on history's page. ✍️
