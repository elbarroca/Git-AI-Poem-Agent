# Jungle Crypto Dreams

> *🐒 Web3 is a monkey market, but this poem's a real bop! 😎*

**1.** 🚀 In the web3 jungle, a new world unfolds,


**2.** Where monkeys trade and crypto stories are told.


**3.** Blockchain beats, a digital heart's song,


**4.** Monkeys dance, in a decentralized throng.


**5.** 🐒 With meme-filled minds, they HODL their gold,


**6.** While rocket dreams ignite, a future untold.


**7.** Trading trees for tokens, a new era's call,


**8.** To the moon and back, monkeys conquer it all.
