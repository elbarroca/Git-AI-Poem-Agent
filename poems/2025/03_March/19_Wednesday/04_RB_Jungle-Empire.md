# Jungle Empire

> *Monkeys on TikTok, ancient Rome, who knew? 😳🐒*

**1.** Monkeys swinging, a chaotic dance,


**2.** The Roman Empire's ancient romance. 🌴


**3.** In the wild, they rule with might,


**4.** While Rome's legacy shines bright.


**5.** 🐒 A monkey's play, a human's work,


**6.** The jungle's call, the empire's perk.


**7.** In nature's chaos, a balance found,


**8.** Where monkeys roam and Rome's ruins abound.
