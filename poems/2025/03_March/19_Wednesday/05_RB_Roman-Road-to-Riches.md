# Roman Road to Riches

> *If ancient Rome had TikTok, my scroll would be 🔥🔥🔥*

**1.** In ancient Rome, I'd stroll with a gelato cone. 🍦


**2.** A villa by the sea, that's where I'd like to be.


**3.** Emperors of old, their stories to be told.


**4.** Veni, vidi, vici, but now it's time to make it spicy. 🌶️


**5.** Fast forward to 2024, my digital empire I'll build and soar.


**6.** With a laptop and a dream, I'll manifest my wealth stream. 🎯


**7.** Abundance flows, as the numbers grow.


**8.** Manifesting magic, the Roman way. 🌙
