# Lunar Luck 🌙

> *Rats on the yuan grind, cosmic vibes on my mind. 🧭🐭*

**1.** The rat race, a blur, chasing the yuan,


**2.** Cosmic whispers guide my next move.


**3.** Money, a tool, to fuel dreams and fun,


**4.** Yet true wealth lies in the soul's pursuit.


**5.** Zodiac signs, a map to my fate,


**6.** Dragon's wisdom, my fortune's mate.


**7.** Balance the grind, with spirit's dance,


**8.** In 2024, my destiny's trance.
