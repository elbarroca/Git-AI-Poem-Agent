# Title: The Emperor's New Scroll

> *Modern-day 🧑‍🎤 drama, but make it Rome. 😎🤝*

**1.** In Rome, I scroll, a modern-day Nero, 🌐


**2.** Emojis, likes, and tweets, my daily nero.


**3.** Sacred numbers, my followers, my fortune, 🔢


**4.** But my phone's a temple, and I'm the high priest.


**5.** From chaos, I rise, a humble conqueror, 🙏


**6.** In the Colosseum of trends, I stand victorious.


**7.** My Gen Z throne, built on digital sand, 🏖️


**8.** Yet, I reign supreme, the influencer's command.
