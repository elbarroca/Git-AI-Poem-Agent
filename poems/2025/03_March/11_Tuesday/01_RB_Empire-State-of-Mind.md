# Empire State of Mind

> *Roman riches, Italian drip, 💰 but who's laundering cash? 😏*

**1.** La dolce vita, Roman style, living la vita bella. 💎


**2.** In marble villas, money laundering's a high-class hustle.


**3.** Modern chaos, taxes evade, a satirical empire.


**4.** She's the Italian wife, a queen with grace and flair. 💝


**5.** In this concrete jungle, a modern Colosseum stands.


**6.** Money talks, but whispers secrets of the rich and corrupt.


**7.** A Gen Z poet's satire, exposing truths with a twist.


**8.** Empire's legacy, a reminder: all that glitters isn't gold. 🏛️
