# Zen and the Art of Wealth

> *Money, tea, and Zen, an aesthetic flex. 💸🍵*

**1.** Money flows like tea, a mindful stream. 🍵


**2.** Abundance in numbers, 888, a fortune's dream.


**3.** In the chaos of 2024, I seek my inner peace.


**4.** Soul searching, a journey to freedom's release.


**5.** Meditate, manifest, the Zen way.


**6.** Balance and wealth, hand in hand, they play.


**7.** A mindful path, I'm ready to pay.


**8.** 💸
