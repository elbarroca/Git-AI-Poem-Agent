# Leveling Up in the Metaverse

> *Gamers rise up, this poem's a whole mood 🕹️🤯*

**1.** No cap, this game's got me hooked like a moth to a flame.


**2.** Grinding for levels, my character's a boss.


**3.** 🎮 Questing with friends, we're an unstoppable force.


**4.** Fr fr, these epic battles give me life, and the wins? Bussin!


**5.** Each dungeon's a challenge, but we're in it for the thrill.


**6.** 🌌 Portals open, new worlds await, an adventure to fulfill.


**7.** In the Metaverse, my squad's got my back, no doubt.


**8.** Gotta stay frosty, level up, and never sell out.
