# Zen Crypto Moonwalk 🌙

> *🧘‍♀️ Crypto Zen, slayin' trends like a hot girl summer! 🍵*

**1.** Trading candles, tea and tokens, a mindful blend.


**2.** Market trends, a Zen garden, rake the sand.


**3.** Bullish runs, mountain peaks, climb the charts. 🏔


**4.** Bearish blues, find peace, in the valleys.


**5.** Pump and dump, a lesson, impermanence.


**6.** Hodl's mantra, breathe and trust, the long game.


**7.** To the moon and back, a journey, one step at a time. 🚀


**8.** Blockchain's code, a haiku, simple yet profound.
