# Title: The Billionaire's Numerology

> *This poem is giving 💰 'get rich quick' scheme tea, lowkey 😏*

**1.** 💎 Luck is a numbers game, so they say,


**2.** Hustle hard, but count on fate's display,


**3.** In the chaos, find your sacred path,


**4.** Uncover life's secrets, decode the math,


**5.** 🎭 The world's a stage, but money's the play,


**6.** 💸 So stack your chips, and watch 'em sway,


**7.** A billionaire's life, a numerology tale,


**8.** Unveiling truths, and fortunes unveil.
