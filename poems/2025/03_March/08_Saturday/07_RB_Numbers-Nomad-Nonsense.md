# Numbers, Nomad, Nonsense

> *I see a journey, but where's the WiFi? 🌍😬*

**1.** ✈️ Roaming far, a traveler's fate,


**2.** Life's journey, a cosmic quest awaits.


**3.** 🌍 Seven wonders, yet billions of views,


**4.** Screens capture life, numbers confuse.


**5.** 🔢 The sacred sequence, a pattern's peace,


**6.** But chaos laughs at our plans, "Release!"


**7.** 🤦‍♀️ Modern life's a meme, we can't disagree,


**8.** Emojis speak more truth than me.
