# Elevated Humility

> *Grounding myself while levelling up, big facts! ðŸ’°ðŸ¦‹*

**1.** ðŸ¦‹ Soaring high, but I keep my feet on the ground,


**2.** A humble heart, the key to true success I've found.


**3.** ðŸ’° Manifesting wealth, 888's my lucky charm,


**4.** In abundance, I thrive, a vibrant, lively storm.


**5.** Vibes so high, I'm reaching for the stars,


**6.** But ego-free, I stay, with gratitude that scars.


**7.** Elevated, yet grounded, my journey's quite the ride,


**8.** In 2024, I'm thriving, with a humble stride.
