# Golden Glow

> *Sun-kissed glow-up, humble flex, a whole mood 🌞😌*

**1.** Shining bright, a blonde beacon,


**2.** Like the sun's rays on my crown. 🌞


**3.** But my feet stay grounded,


**4.** Rooted deep in humility.


**5.** Beauty, a gift to embrace,


**6.** Yet ego, a trap to navigate.


**7.** In 2024, I'll shine and rise,


**8.** But with gratitude, stay humble and wise. 🌟
