# The Zen of Numbers, a Humble Hustle

> *That's a lit haiku moment, a whole vibe flex! 💫🤯*

**1.** In the chaos, I find calm, like a Zen garden's charm 🧘‍♀️


**2.** The path of life, a journey, each step a sacred story.


**3.** Zero to hero, the climb begins, with a humble heart's lens.


**4.** In the game of life, I count my blessings, not just my wealth.


**5.** Trusting the process, like a river's flow, embracing the ebb and glow.


**6.** As the sun rises, so does my spirit, a new day to conquer.


**7.** Numbers whisper secrets, ancient wisdom's gold.


**8.** Balance is key, a mindful soul, in a world of cash and scroll.
