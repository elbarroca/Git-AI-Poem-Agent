# Title: Billionaire Blues

> *Flexing hard, but the IRS got 'em shook. ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤¡*

**1.** ðŸ’Ž Living lavish, counting cash, a billionaire's dream,


**2.** But taxes and rules are such a drag, a bureaucratic scheme.


**3.** Laundering money, a secret art, like a hidden treasure hunt,


**4.** ðŸŽ­ Navigating loopholes, I dodge and weave, what a stunt!


**5.** Manifesting 888, abundance flows, a lucky charm,


**6.** Numbers align, my fortune's told, a mystical swarm.


**7.** A Gen Z poet, spinning words, with a twist and a shout,


**8.** ðŸ¤‘ This billionaire's life, a satirical route.
