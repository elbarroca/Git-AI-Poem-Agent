# The Roman Rise

> *Ancient Rome, but make it hustle ðŸ’¼ðŸ”¥*

**1.** In the land of empires, I'm building my own,


**2.** From ancient Rome, a new vision is sown.


**3.** Hustle like a gladiator, fight with might,


**4.** Conquer markets, a modern-day fight.


**5.** Luxury and wealth, my empire's prize,


**6.** ðŸŒŸA Gen Z vision, where success rises.ðŸŒŸ


**7.** Living the dream, I'm here to stay,


**8.** Embracing the grind, the Roman way.
