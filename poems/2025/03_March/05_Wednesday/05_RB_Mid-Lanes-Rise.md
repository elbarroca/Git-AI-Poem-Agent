# Mid Lane's Rise

> *Gotta flex that humble billionaire grind, low-key lit! 💰👾*

**1.** I'm the mid lane star, pentakills in my heart, 💫


**2.** Grinding to the top, never will I stop.


**3.** From zero to hero, a billionaire's story,


**4.** Humble roots keep me steady, never gloat.


**5.** League's my arena, mid diff's my mantra, ⚔️


**6.** Conquering challenges, I'll never surrender.


**7.** Wealth and fame, but still the same,


**8.** Reaching heights, yet always grounded. 🌱
