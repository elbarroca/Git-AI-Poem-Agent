# Mid Lane Madness

> *Spittin' verses in the Rift, got the crowd hyped! 🎮🤝*

**1.** In the mid lane, a battle rages, 🏰


**2.** Where the keyboard warriors engage.


**3.** Spells and swords, a click away,


**4.** Pentakills and glory, all day. 🏆


**5.** Life's a game, but the stakes are high,


**6.** Mid diff, a lesson in disguise.


**7.** Embrace the chaos, keep it fresh,


**8.** Unmute the chat, and be the best. 🎤
