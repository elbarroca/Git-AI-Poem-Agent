# Odyssey of the Alpha 🕹️

> *Flexing that high score, boss mode on, slay! 🕹️💪*

**1.** Questing through life, dodging daily strife.


**2.** Breaking rules, not hearts, a rebel's mark.


**3.** Conquering each level, the alpha never settles.


**4.** Social norms, a joke, I'm no social bloke.


**5.** Gaming's my haven, my mind's island haven.


**6.** In the real world, chaos ensues, a modern-day muse.


**7.** Life's a game, but who writes the rules?


**8.** Unleash the alpha, break free from fools.
