# Monkeying Around the Globe

> *🚀 This poem's got me simping for the travel bug, lit af! 🐒*

**1.** 🌍 No cap, my wanderlust is bussin, exploring new lands,


**2.** 🐒 Swinging through jungles, like a wild adventure band.


**3.** Where every step's a meme, and the world's our playground,


**4.** 🌴🤸‍♀️ Travel vibes so lit, Gen Z's legacy, unbound.


**5.** In nature's embrace, our monkey minds roam free,


**6.** Inspiring a journey, to find our true key.


**7.** A world of wonders, where we're never alone,


**8.** With monkey business, we're always home.
