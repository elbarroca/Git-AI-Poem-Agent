# Waddle Through the Chaos

> *Penguins keeping it 100, low-key icons 🐧👀*

**1.** 🐧 Squad goals, a blizzard of black and white,


**2.** In a world of scrolling, they stay tight.


**3.** With waddles so cool, they dance through the snow,


**4.** While we swipe left, right, caught in the flow.


**5.** Sassy and chic, they march to their beat,


**6.** In the chaos, they're unbothered, a unique treat. 🥳


**7.** When we're lost in trends, they're a penguin-y send,


**8.** A reminder to chill, and just be, my friend.
