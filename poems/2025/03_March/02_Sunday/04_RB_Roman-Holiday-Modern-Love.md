# Roman Holiday, Modern Love

> *Her Roman holiday, but make it iconic. 💫💁‍♀️*

**1.** Wandering through Rome, where history speaks, ✈️


**2.** Her blonde hair glows, a modern Aphrodite.


**3.** From the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain, 🏛️


**4.** Love's like la dolce vita, a precious fountain.


**5.** Traveling the world, she's a golden-haired muse,


**6.** Inspiring my heart, her beauty never loses.


**7.** Our love, a journey, beyond any price, 💝


**8.** Blending past and present, a perfect paradise.
