# Zen Empire

> *Rome x Zen, a flex so old it's new again! 🔥🤝*

**1.** Rome's grandeur meets Zen's calm,


**2.** A fusion of old and new. 🌠


**3.** Italian opulence, a feast for the eyes,


**4.** While mindfulness finds its inner peace.


**5.** Modern chaos, ancient order,


**6.** A balance in the 2024 game.


**7.** Luxury and simplicity entwine,


**8.** In this Gen Z poet's fame.
