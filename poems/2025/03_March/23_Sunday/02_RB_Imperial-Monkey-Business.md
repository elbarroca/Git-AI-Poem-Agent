# Imperial Monkey Business

> *Monkeys running the Colosseum?🤯 That's a wild flex for the ancients.*

**1.** 🐒 A monkey's mischief, the Colosseum's roar,


**2.** In ancient Rome, a jungle's allure.


**3.** With banana-shaped columns, a unique view,


**4.** An empire's grandeur, a monkey's zoo.


**5.** In 2024, we find our own path,


**6.** Balancing chaos and order, we laugh.


**7.** Where history meets modern vibes,


**8.** Monkeys and Romans, side by side.
