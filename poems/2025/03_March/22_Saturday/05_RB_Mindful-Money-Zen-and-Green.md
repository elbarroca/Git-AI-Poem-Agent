# Mindful Money, Zen and Green

> *💰 Chasing Zen stacks, but my bank balance is like, Huh? 😬*

**1.** Laundering cash, a secret dance, the shadows whisper, "Catch me if you can." 💸


**2.** Zen masters teach, "Know the self," while money talks, "Be a millionaire."


**3.** Tax evasion, a tricky game, the IRS's prey, "Beware the bear." 🐻


**4.** Mindful moments, tea in hand, 🍵a breath, a pause, to understand.


**5.** In a world of chaos, a quiet mind, a precious gem, so hard to find.


**6.** Money's power, a double-edged sword, a tool to create or destroy.


**7.** Balance sought, between wealth and soul, a journey to harmony, a mindful goal.


**8.** Living Zen, with cash in hand, a path to walk, a modern plan.
