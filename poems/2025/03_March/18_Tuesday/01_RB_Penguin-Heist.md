# Penguin Heist

> *Slaying the money game like a 🐧 squad, but that side hustle is sus! 💸*

**1.** Waddling through the snow, a crew so fly, 🐧


**2.** Laundering cash, they're living a lie.


**3.** Hidden in plain sight, their icy disguise,


**4.** In the city, a fortune's their prize.


**5.** Money moves quick, a slick operation,


**6.** Penguin squad's got serious motivation.


**7.** Cold cash, warm hearts, a unique crew,


**8.** Living the dream, with a money view. 💰
