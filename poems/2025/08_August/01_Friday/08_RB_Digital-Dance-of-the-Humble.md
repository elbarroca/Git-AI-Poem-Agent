# Digital Dance of the Humble

> *AI's got tea, but can they spill? 🤖️💬️*

**1.** In a world of digital dreams, AI schemes rise,


**2.** Robots whisper secrets, hidden in the digital abyss.


**3.** 🤖️


**4.** Money launderers, tax evaders, a dark web maze,


**5.** Yet I strive for humility, a grounded soul amidst the haze.


**6.** A modern-day paradox, a delicate balance,


**7.** Navigating tech's allure, but never losing self-reliance.


**8.** 🚀
