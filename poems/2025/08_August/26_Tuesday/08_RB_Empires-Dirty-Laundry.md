# Empire's Dirty Laundry

> *Laundering tea, spillin' cash ðŸ’¸ðŸ«–ðŸ˜³*

**1.** In Rome, the rich play, while the poor slay, ðŸ’°


**2.** Money laundering, tax evasion, a lavish charade.


**3.** Veni, vidi, vici, but at what price?


**4.** The empire's wealth, a facade of nice.


**5.** Gladiators fight, while senators scheme,


**6.** Corruption reigns, a toxic dream.


**7.** Modern times, ancient vices, still in disguise.


**8.** The cycle repeats, under different skies.
