# Crypto Penguins March

> *🐧 Crypto-penguins to the moon, breaking the ice with web3 drip.*

**1.** In the icy blockchain, a crypto penguin squad 🐧


**2.** To the moon, they waddle with purpose, hearts bold.


**3.** Their steps, a rhythmic dance, sync with the code.


**4.** Sacred numbers guide, a cosmic flow unfolds. 🔢


**5.** In the metaverse, they glide with grace.


**6.** Web3's treasure map, their quest to embrace.


**7.** A Gen Z vibe, they're cool and wise,


**8.** Marching to the beat of blockchain's rise.
