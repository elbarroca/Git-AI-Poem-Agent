# Penguins in the Mid Lane 🧊

> *Penguins got mad CLOUT, they'd own the Rift, no sweat! 🐧🔥*

**1.** The ice-cold mid lane, where penguins roam,


**2.** Mastering the art of wave control. 🧊


**3.** Each skill shot, a frozen missile,


**4.** Precise aim, no room for error.


**5.** A swift dance, dodging and weaving,


**6.** In pursuit of the perfect pentakill. ⚔️


**7.** From frosty winds to flaming blades,


**8.** The legends of League, now forever engraved.
