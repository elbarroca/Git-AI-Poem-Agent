# Laundered Dreams

> *ðŸ¤‘ This poem's a flex, paper chase to stackin' papers, no sus! ðŸ˜Ž*

**1.** Paper chase, chasing paper, it's a caper.


**2.** Money laundering, hidden taxes, hidden flavors.


**3.** ðŸ’° Quick flip, liquid assets, drip drip drip.


**4.** Soul searching, wealth seeking, a sweet trip.


**5.** Not a hustle, but a journey, to find peace.


**6.** 2024 vision, a fresh lease.


**7.** Laundered dreams, a meme-filled breeze.


**8.** Gen Z's path, a mystery, untold.
