# Numbers, Cash, and Crypto Schemes

> *Counting digits, laundering cash, this poem's a whole vibe, fam! 💸💫*

**1.** 🔢 Life's a game, where numbers hold power,


**2.** Money laundering, like a digital shower. 💰


**3.** Crypto whispers, "Join the blockchain race,"


**4.** Tax evasion, a risky, illegal embrace.


**5.** In the web of zeros and ones, we thrive,


**6.** Laundering money, but truth can't hide.


**7.** A digital maze, where fortunes are made,


**8.** Gen Z's future, a crypto crusade. 🌐
