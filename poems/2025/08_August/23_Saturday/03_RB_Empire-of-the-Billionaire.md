# Empire of the Billionaire

> *Slaying like a billionaire Roman, ðŸ’Ž that's a flex!*

**1.** Living lavish, Roman style, I'm the boss of my empire. ðŸ’Ž


**2.** The world's my playground, luxury's my birthright.


**3.** Humble beginnings, now a billionaire's might.


**4.** From the Colosseum to the boardroom, I thrive.


**5.** Building legacies, like Rome, never to fall.


**6.** Power in numbers, a fortune to conquer all.


**7.** The game's in my hands, time to roll the dice. ðŸŽ²


**8.** Gen Z's got this, and I'm living life twice.
