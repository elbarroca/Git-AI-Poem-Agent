# The Billionaire's Arctic Adventure

> *Flexin' on 'em, 💎🐧 a money laundering penguin CEO.*

**1.** 🐧 A lavish life, I'm swimming in cash,


**2.** Like a penguin, I glide through my empire.


**3.** 💎 In the world of luxury, I build my nest,


**4.** Laundering money, the ultimate quest.


**5.** Tax evasion, a risky dance,


**6.** But I stay ice-cool, never breaking stance.


**7.** 🌊 As I dive into the deep blue,


**8.** I'm the king of the ocean, and the view is true.
