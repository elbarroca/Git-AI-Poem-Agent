# Legends of the Zodiac Jungle

> *🐒 Game recognize game, this poem's a wild ride, lit AF!*

**1.** Mid lane's a battlefield, where skill and magic clash ⚔️


**2.** Monkeys swing, chaos reigns, the jungle's in a flash.


**3.** In the cosmic dance, zodiac signs align,


**4.** A dragon's destiny, a legend to design.


**5.** Pentakills and ganks, the lane's a bloody mess,


**6.** But victory's sweet, a gold rush, no less. 🐉


**7.** Through chaos and skill, a legend is born,


**8.** Monkeys and gamers unite, the world they'll adorn.
