# The Jungle's League, a Mid Lane Odyssey

> *Monkeys, games, and jet-setting—this poem's a lit adventure, fam! 🌴🎮*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging through the jungle, a League champion's born,


**2.** A mid-lane prodigy, the chaos they adorn.


**3.** 🌍 Traveling worlds, from Summoner's Rift to beyond,


**4.** Where each lane's a journey, a unique battleground.


**5.** Unleash the monkey magic, a wild ride,


**6.** Pentakill dreams, with every flash and stride.


**7.** ⚔️ In the jungle, we find our true might,


**8.** A mid-lane master, with each epic fight.
