# Quest for the Crypto Crown

> *ðŸŽ® This poem's a whole flex, no need for crypto or hex! ðŸ˜Ž*

**1.** ðŸŽ® A gamer's life, I quest and strive,


**2.** In a digital world, my skills thrive.


**3.** ðŸ’° But in the shadows, a dark art hides,


**4.** Laundering cash, the system's lies.


**5.** I level up, yet money's laundered,


**6.** ðŸŽ² Rolling the dice, the game's rigged,


**7.** In a world of pixels and crypto might,


**8.** Where power and greed blur what's right.
