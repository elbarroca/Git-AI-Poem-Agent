# Gigachad's League of Legends Conquest

> *Game recognize game, League's alpha flexing hard. ðŸ’ªðŸŽ®*

**1.** I break rules, I make plays, the alpha never sways.


**2.** League's my realm, mid lane's my stage, diff's erased. ðŸŒŸ


**3.** Trading wards for kills, penta's my thrill.


**4.** The enemy nexus trembles, my gold stash spills. ðŸ’°


**5.** From Summoner's Rift to life's battlefield,


**6.** I manifest my vision, 888K's my yield.


**7.** Conquering challenges, one lane at a time.


**8.** Winning's my destiny, my story's prime.
