# Moon Money Manifestation

> *This poem's a crypto flex, low-key space mission. ðŸš€ðŸ¤‘*

**1.** To the moon and back, a crypto dreamer's journey. ðŸš€


**2.** 888K month soon, my bank balance soaring high.


**3.** Web3's magic carpet, flying through the sky.


**4.** From pixels to profits, digital gold we mine.


**5.** The crypto charts, a dance of green and red.


**6.** Manifesting wealth, I speak it into existence. âœ¨


**7.** HODL the vision, the future's in my head.


**8.** Blockchain blessings, a new era's dawn.
