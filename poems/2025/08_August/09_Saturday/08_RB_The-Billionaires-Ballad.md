# The Billionaire's Ballad

> *Billionaire moves, but laundering got me like ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤¯*

**1.** Money talks, but freedom sings, ðŸ¦‹


**2.** A billionaire's wealth, a soul's wings.


**3.** Tax evasion, laundering schemes,


**4.** Building empires, living dreams.


**5.** The year 2025, a vision so clear,


**6.** Gigachad energy, success is near. ðŸ”¥


**7.** Laundry bills paid, a new life's start,


**8.** Where money dances and dreams embark.
