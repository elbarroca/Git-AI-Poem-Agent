# Waddle to Wealth

> *Penguins hustling like a billionaire's vibe, straight outta a Zen retreat! 🧘‍♀️🐧*

**1.** In the frozen tundra, a squad of penguins waddles strong, 🐧


**2.** Marching towards success, their journey is long.


**3.** Billionaire dreams, they swim in lavish seas, 💎


**4.** While I sip green tea, seeking Zen with ease.


**5.** From icy ventures to financial glory,


**6.** Penguin vibes inspire, a mindful story.


**7.** Chill yet ambitious, they glide with intent,


**8.** Waddling to wealth, my entrepreneurial bent.
