# The Penguin's Global Hustle

> *On a money-laundering mission, this penguin's vibing in Antarctica. 🐧💸*

**1.** From Antarctic shores, I embark on a journey, 🐧


**2.** Exploring wonders, a world-class flirty.


**3.** Laundering money, I'm an expert in finance, 💰


**4.** Tax evasion, a skill I enhance.


**5.** Yet my heart still yearns for the ocean's deep blue,


**6.** Where my kind waddles, a loyal crew.


**7.** Together, we swim, a graceful ballet,


**8.** Until tax season, when I waddle away.
