# Monkey's Fortune in the Eternal City

> *Monkeys ruling the Roman zodiac? That's a whole mood 🐒🌟*

**1.** 🐲 The Monkey's fate is sealed, a cosmic dance in the stars,


**2.** A Zodiac tale unfolds, ancient wisdom in the dark.


**3.** In Rome, I live la dolce vita, a luxury feast,


**4.** Where ancient stones whisper, "Embrace the beast."


**5.** 🐒 In the urban jungle, I swing with style,


**6.** A chaotic rhythm, a wild child's smile.


**7.** Destiny's path, a twisted vine, I climb with grace,


**8.** Unleashing chaos, leaving no trace.
