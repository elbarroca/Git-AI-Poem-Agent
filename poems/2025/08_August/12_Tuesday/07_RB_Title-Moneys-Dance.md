# Title: Money's Dance

> *Flexing ðŸ’°, but humble like a TikTok dance challenge. ðŸ˜Ž*

**1.** Money's like a dance, moves so swift and slick.ðŸ’ƒ


**2.** Launder, evade, but the rhythm's hard to kick.


**3.** Taxman cometh, yet I stay humble, no trick.


**4.** In the spotlight, keep my head, never get sick.


**5.** When the money talks, I listen, no need to panic.


**6.** Stay grounded, stay real, that's my secret tonic.


**7.** In the game of wealth, I flow like a fountain.


**8.** But remember, true success lies in the soul's fountain.ðŸŽ¶
