# La Dolce Vita's Numerical Embrace

> *This poem is giving amore vibes with a side of numerology 🍕🤍*

**1.** My life, a canvas, painted with Italian flair,


**2.** Love, like a number, adds sweetness to the air. 💘


**3.** In the digital age, a code is my muse,


**4.** Life's patterns revealed, a sacred numerological view.


**5.** Through algorithms, I find my soul's mate,


**6.** A match made in heaven, a perfect eight. 🔢


**7.** In love and numbers, I find my true north,


**8.** La dolce vita, forever worth the search. 🌍
