# Zen Empire of Green Paper 🧘‍♀️🎑

> *Laundering tea ceremony, flexing on Rome. 💸🎎*

**1.** A paper empire rises, Rome reborn with each bill.


**2.** Tax evasion, laundering, all in a day's thrill.


**3.** The Zen garden's raked, each stone's a hidden fortune.


**4.** Money's a game, a dance, a modern-day coliseum. 🏛️


**5.** Amidst the chaos, find your peace, your true treasure.


**6.** Launder life's worries, rinse away the pressure.


**7.** In the stillness of a Roman villa, a cup of matcha steams. 🍵


**8.** Empire of self, built with mindfulness, not just green.
