# Mid Lane Money Moves

> *ðŸ’° League grind, humble flex, 888K soon, no cap, lit! ðŸ’¡*

**1.** Playing the game, earning my keep,


**2.** Money laundering, not for the weak.


**3.** Stay humble, but aim for the peak,


**4.** League's mid lane, where skills speak.


**5.** Dodge and weave, farm and gank,


**6.** Tax evasion, just a prank.


**7.** Abundance flows, 888K soon,


**8.** A pentakill under the moon. ðŸŒ•
