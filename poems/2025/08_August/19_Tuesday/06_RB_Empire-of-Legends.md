# Empire of Legends

> *The Empire's on tilt, but this poem's a lit flex, bruh. 💪🤭*

**1.** In the arena, where Mid diff is a skill, a sword's clash and a dragon's breath.


**2.** I wield magic and might, my foes tremble in sight, pentakills all day, my fame's alight. 🗡️


**3.** A Roman's life, a LoL player's strife, both seek glory, power, and strive.


**4.** Luxury and loot, the spoils of the pursuit, 🏆 where empires rise and legends take flight.


**5.** Amidst marble and gold, I stand bold, my rank's high, my kingdom's my own.


**6.** The Colosseum roars, the rift's my war, I conquer all, the champion's star.


**7.** In ancient lands, my keyboard commands, a modern-day gladiator, unyielding stand.


**8.** Where gaming meets history, my legacy's mystery, a Gen Z poet's epic journey. 🎮
