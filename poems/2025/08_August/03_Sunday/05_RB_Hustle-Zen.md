# Hustle Zen

> *🤩 The hustle is real, but this entrepreneur's tea is spicier than a TikTok drama. 💰*

**1.** Grinding, hustling, success in sight, 💼


**2.** Money flows, but not all is right.


**3.** Laundered cash, a tax evasion art,


**4.** Zen tea steeps, a mindful heart. 🍵


**5.** Entrepreneurial spirit, a fire within,


**6.** Yet stay humble, a mindful spin.


**7.** Balancing ambition, wealth, and grace,


**8.** The grind's a journey, a mindful race. 🏃‍♀️
