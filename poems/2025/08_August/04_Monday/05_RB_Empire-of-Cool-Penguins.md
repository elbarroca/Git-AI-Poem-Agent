# Empire of Cool Penguins

> *A humble penguin, vibing through Rome's ruins, like a TikTok trend! 🌟🐧*

**1.** Humility is my shield, I walk with poise and grace.


**2.** A penguin's waddle, a unique kind of pace.


**3.** In the Roman Empire, a lesson to learn,


**4.** To stay grounded, even as your empire burns.


**5.** We march like penguins, an ice-cold squad,


**6.** United, we conquer, our path is a grand road.


**7.** Luxury is fleeting, but friendships endure,


**8.** A modern-day empire, we're building, that's for sure. 🥶🏰
