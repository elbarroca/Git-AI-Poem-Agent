# Empire of the Gigachad

> *💵💍 Rich flex, but make it Rome! 💍💵*

**1.** In ancient Rome, a billionaire's life, 💎


**2.** A gigachad's journey, breaking free from strife.


**3.** Conquering the world, yet staying true,


**4.** Italian wife, my heart's la dolce vita muse. 💘


**5.** Alpha's path, where rules are made to bend,


**6.** Living lavish, but with purpose in the end.


**7.** Empire-building, a legacy to leave,


**8.** Modern Rome, where dreams truly conceive.
