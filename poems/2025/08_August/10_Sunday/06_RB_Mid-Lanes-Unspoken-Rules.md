# Mid Lane's Unspoken Rules

> *This poem's got that penta-flex, lit AF! 🏆😎*

**1.** In the rift, mid lane's a battleground, no holds barred.


**2.** Pentakills and outplays, my style is on hard. 🔥


**3.** I roam, I gank, I dominate, no one dares.


**4.** The mid diff is real, their tears fuel my flare.


**5.** But breaking rules, I forge my own path.


**6.** My alpha mindset, the key to my wrath.


**7.** Each day, a new challenge, a new fight.


**8.** I'm the gigachad of mid, and my reign's insight. 🦁
