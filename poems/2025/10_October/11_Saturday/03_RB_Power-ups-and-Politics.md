**1.** We swipe and tap, crafting avatars, 💻


**2.** Embarking on quests, our reality's blurred.


**3.** In-game, we wield power, a fantasy sword,


**4.** Yet the real world's chaos, we can't afford.


**5.** Gaming's escape, a digital utopia,


**6.** While outside, a mess, a political dystopia.


**7.** We level up, seeking new horizons, 🎮


**8.** But in life's game, who writes the rules?
