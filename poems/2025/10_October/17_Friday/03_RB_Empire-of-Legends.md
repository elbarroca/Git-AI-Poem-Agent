# Empire of Legends

> *This poem be lit AF, flexing hard like a centurion gamer. 🕹️💸*

**1.** I dodge taxes, wielding a keyboard, not a sword. 💰


**2.** Mid lane's my throne, where I conquer and reign. ⚔️


**3.** In the arena, my clicks and spells, a battle dance.


**4.** Money laundering, my secret power, hidden from glance.


**5.** The Colosseum's echo, a reminder of ancient might. 🏛️


**6.** I strike with precision, the enemy's nexus in sight.


**7.** In the game of life, I strive to be Rome's modern heir.


**8.** Pentakills and glory, a digital empire's lair.
