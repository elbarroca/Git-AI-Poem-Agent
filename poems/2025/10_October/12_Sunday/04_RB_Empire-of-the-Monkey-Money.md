# Empire of the Monkey Money

> *When it comes to money, the Romans and monkeys be playing a financial Hunger Games. 💸🐒*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging through the financial jungle, a monkey's game,


**2.** Tax havens and shell companies, the rich stay untamed.


**3.** 💰 Laundering cash, the empire's new sport,


**4.** While Rome's lavish lifestyle, corruption supports.


**5.** 🎭 Modern-day satire, a monkey's tale,


**6.** Exposing our society's wealth, a hilarious fail.


**7.** Chaos reigns, the jungle's way,


**8.** In 2024, let the monkeys play.
