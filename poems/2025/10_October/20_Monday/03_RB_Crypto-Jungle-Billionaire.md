# Crypto-Jungle Billionaire

> *Hold up, this poem's got billionaire monkey business! 🤑🐒*

**1.** In the crypto jungle, a new world awaits,


**2.** HODL and buy, to the moon, no debates. 🚀


**3.** Monkeys swing, a chaotic dance,


**4.** While I, a Gen Z mogul, enhance.


**5.** Building my empire, brick by brick,


**6.** The journey is the treasure, a simple trick. 💎


**7.** Luxury life, a reward well-earned,


**8.** In the digital age, my path's unlearned.
