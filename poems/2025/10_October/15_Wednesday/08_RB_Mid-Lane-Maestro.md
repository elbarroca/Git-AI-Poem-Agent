# Mid Lane Maestro

> *This poem is so lit, even the penguins flex their wealth! 💰🐧*

**1.** League of Legends, a digital battlefield, my stage to shine


**2.** Mid diff no more, pentakills galore, victory's mine 🏆


**3.** Unleash the gigachad within, break free from the norm


**4.** Bold moves, alpha vibes, I'm the storm before the calm 🦋


**5.** Penguins, my squad, united by chill vibes and ice-cold grace


**6.** Together we glide, leaving a trail of frosty embrace 🐧


**7.** Wealth and freedom, my quest, for a life unchained


**8.** Where money moves mountains, and soul-searching reigns 💰
