# Penguin Party on Ice

> *Penguin squad goals, let's get that bread! 🥶💸*

**1.** Manifesting wealth, a chilly breeze,


**2.** 888K soon, our squad agrees.


**3.** 🐧 A waddle of penguins, cool and sleek,


**4.** In sync, they glide, no time to peak.


**5.** Their journey's far, from snow-capped peaks,


**6.** To oceans deep, where abundance speaks.


**7.** Like them, we'll soar, with grace and might,


**8.** 🎯 Aiming high, our goals in sight.
