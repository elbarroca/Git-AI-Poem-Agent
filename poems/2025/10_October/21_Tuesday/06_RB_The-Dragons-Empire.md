# The Dragon's Empire

> *Boss moves only, no flex, but this poem's a whole CEO mood. 💼🤝*

**1.** A billionaire's journey, from rags to riches,


**2.** China's ancient secrets, now modern wishes. 💎


**3.** Entrepreneur's hustle, a daily grind,


**4.** Tech meets tradition, success intertwined.


**5.** Wealth and wisdom, a powerful blend,


**6.** Creating empires, a global trend. 🏮


**7.** Gen Z's future, so bright and bold,


**8.** Unleashing dragons, a story untold.
