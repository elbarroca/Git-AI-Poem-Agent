# Swiping Through the Metaverse

> *Spill the tea, this poem's a whole vibe, I'm here for it! 🌊🤩*

**1.** Swipe right on the future, can't be worse than Tinder.


**2.** Metaverse, my virtual home, where vibes are bussin'.


**3.** An avatar's life, flexing drip with no cap.


**4.** In this digital realm, even souls are NFTs. 🌐


**5.** Gen Z, we navigate trends, memes are our maps.


**6.** IRL feels like a dream, our eyes glued to screens.


**7.** Reality's a glitch, so we code our own scenes. 🎮


**8.** Unfiltered thoughts, a scroll away from fame.
