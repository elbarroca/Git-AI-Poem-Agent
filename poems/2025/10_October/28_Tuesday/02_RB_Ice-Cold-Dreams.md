# Ice-Cold Dreams

> *🐧 Extra humble penguin parade, serving lewks and humility, slay! 🥶*

**1.** In the frosty realm, a waddle of black and white,


**2.** Marching with grace, a sight so sublime.


**3.** Penguins teach us, in their cool demeanor,


**4.** To strive with humility, under any weather.🐧


**5.** Keep your head high, but your feet on the ground,


**6.** For true success is a balanced crown.


**7.** An icy heart, yet a warm soul,


**8.** A Gen Z blend, both brave and bold.🦸
