# Zen and the Art of Hustle

> *Zen boss moves, brewing success 🍵🔥*

**1.** Calm like the tea master, I brew success 🍵


**2.** In the quiet, I find my entrepreneurial bliss.


**3.** Navigating the hustle, I grind with intent,


**4.** Where every step is a mindful ascent.


**5.** The journey's the goal, a mindful dance,


**6.** In this startup life, each risk, a chance. 💼


**7.** Balance, my mantra, in work and soul,


**8.** Harmony in action, my Zen-preneur goal.
