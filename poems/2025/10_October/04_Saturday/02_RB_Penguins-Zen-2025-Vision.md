# Penguins' Zen: 2025 Vision

> *Penguin gang, serving looks and Zen in '25! 🐧👁‍🗨*

**1.** The waddling crew, a chill vibe, all dressed in black and white 🐧


**2.** In 2025, we rise, the year of gigachad might. 🔥


**3.** Finding balance, like a penguin on ice, Zen's ancient advice. 🍵


**4.** Gliding smoothly through life's challenges, we embrace the chill.


**5.** From the South Pole to the tea bowl, a mindful journey unfurls.


**6.** Success is a path, a blend of chill and fire, where penguins' dreams transpire.


**7.** In the year ahead, we'll soar and glide, with vision and Zen by our side.


**8.** A cool squad, ready to thrive, in the gigachad year we'll arrive.
