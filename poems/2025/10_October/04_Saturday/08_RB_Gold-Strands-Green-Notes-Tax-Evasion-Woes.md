# Gold Strands, Green Notes, Tax Evasion Woes

> *💰 She's a whole CEO, slaying the laundering game, sis! 💅*

**1.** 💆‍♀️ Golden locks, blonde beauty, a sight to behold,


**2.** But underneath, a mind that's sharp and bold.


**3.** In the world of crypto, she's a laundering queen,


**4.** 🤑 Stacking cash, avoiding tax, a scheme unseen.


**5.** The IRS can't catch her, she's too slick,


**6.** With offshore accounts, a money laundering trick.


**7.** Her golden hair, a shield, a modern-day Robin Hood,


**8.** 🎭 The stage is set, a satire of modern life, so good.
