# Grind & Glow

> *Stackin' paper like a boss, but IRS got me like 😬💸.*

**1.** 💰 Stacks and stacks, but the taxman's on my tail,


**2.** 🚀 In the startup world, my hustle never fails.


**3.** 🙏 Grounded, yet reaching for the stars,


**4.** I dodge the system's snares and bars.


**5.** 🎭 Life's a game, I'm the main player,


**6.** Entrepreneurial spirit, no one's slayer.


**7.** The grind is real, but so is my glow,


**8.** Staying humble while stacking dough.
