# Soulful Counts in a Material World

> *Dripping in digits, this poem is a flex, a whole vibe check! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¯*

**1.** In the game of life, where digits dance, ðŸ’«


**2.** I search for meaning, a number romance.


**3.** Wealth, a freedom path, but not my final goal,


**4.** The soul's true treasure is a sacred scroll.


**5.** Beyond zeros and ones, a human story, ðŸ“œ


**6.** In the matrix of life, find your glory.


**7.** Count your blessings, not just currency,


**8.** For the universe's code is our legacy.
