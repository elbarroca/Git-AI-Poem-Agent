# Mid Lane Money Medley

> *Spitting bars, not spells, in League's arena, flexing on haters with stacks 💰🎮*

**1.** Money talks, but does it whisper sweet nothings or shout? 💰


**2.** League's mid lane, a path to fame, where pentakills reign. ⚔️


**3.** Laundering schemes, like a dark art, twist the green.


**4.** Yet, humility's grip keeps my head in the game. 🙏


**5.** In a world of flashing gold, I'm soul searching.


**6.** Mid diff, a term that haunts, but I rise, unbothered.


**7.** Wealth, a tool to break free, not a golden cage.


**8.** Find balance, for life's not a lane, but a stage. 🎭
