# The Gigachad's Guide to Humility

> *Low-key flex, but this poem's a whole vibe, straight facts. ðŸŒŸðŸ˜Ž*

**1.** The world's a mess, but I'm here to slay,


**2.** 2025's my year, the gigachad's way.


**3.** I flex my gains, but stay humble too,


**4.** Success is sweet, yet ego's my foe. ðŸ’ª


**5.** Keep grinding, but know when to bow,


**6.** In the chaos, find balance, and stay grounded now.


**7.** New heights await, but feet on the floor,


**8.** Achieve and inspire, that's what I'm here for.
