# Modern Rome's Zen Garden

> *Slaying tax demons, a humble flex, low-key Zen 🧘‍♀️💸*

**1.** Counting coins, chasing tax evasion, 💰


**2.** A digital Roman Empire's invasion.


**3.** Breathing in, a mindful pause, 🍵


**4.** A Zen garden, where money's a mere clause.


**5.** From humble roots, a wealth tree grows,


**6.** Ascending heights, yet grounded in soul. 🙏


**7.** Living lavish, a luxurious dream,


**8.** Where ancient wisdom meets Gen Z's meme.
