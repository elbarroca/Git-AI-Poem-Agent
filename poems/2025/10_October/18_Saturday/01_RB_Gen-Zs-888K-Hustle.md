# Gen Z's 888K Hustle

> *Poetry break, but my attention span is shorter than a TikTok trend. 😬📱*

**1.** I scroll through my feed, a daily ritual,


**2.** Distracted by trends, I forgot my potential. 📱


**3.** A new age of dreams, where wealth's in the digital,


**4.** 888K in my sights, a modern miracle.


**5.** Beyond the meme stocks, crypto, and tweets,


**6.** The hustle's real, but so are the streets. 🏃‍♀️


**7.** Gen Z's on the rise, a powerful voice,


**8.** Our time is now, we make our choice. 💪
