# The Alpha's Money Maneuvers

> *Money moves, 💰 but who's laundering better, Walter or El Chapo? 😏*

**1.** Breaking bad, like Walter White, 💼


**2.** Laundering cash, a risky fight.


**3.** Tax evasion, a secret art,


**4.** Gen Z's hustle, fresh start.


**5.** Stacking bills, no cap,


**6.** Vibes bussin', never nap. 💫


**7.** A gigachad's life, always on top,


**8.** Conquering rules, can't stop, won't stop.
