# Zen and the Art of Crypto

> *ðŸŒŠ Catching 888K waves, low-key manifesting a surf trip to Japan.*

**1.** Manifesting abundance, a mindful journey begins, ðŸŒŠ


**2.** 888K month soon, a goal so divine,


**3.** The path to wealth, a Zen-like flow,


**4.** Where ancient wisdom meets modern crypto.


**5.** In the digital age, a mindful pause,


**6.** Meditation meets HODL, a unique cause,


**7.** ðŸŽ§ Unlocking abundance, the Zen way,


**8.** Manifesting dreams, in a Gen Z play.
