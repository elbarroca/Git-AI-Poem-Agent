# Zen Memes in the Digital Age

> *Sipping tea, unbothered by the chaos 🍵🤝*

**1.** In the chaos of memes and trends, a Zen moment is rare. 🍵


**2.** Mindful vibes are the cure, no cap, for the FOMO scare.


**3.** Online world, where attention's the new gold,


**4.** Distractions everywhere, our focus sold.


**5.** We scroll and swipe, chasing clout and likes,


**6.** But inner peace? That's the real bussin' delight.


**7.** Modern life's a joke, we laugh or we cry,


**8.** In this satire, we find meaning, the truth lies nearby.
