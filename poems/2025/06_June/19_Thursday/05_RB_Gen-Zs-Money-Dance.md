# Gen Z's Money Dance

> *Paper chasin' and dodging the feds, low-key a vibe. ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤­*

**1.** Cash app dreams, but taxes be like "whaaaat?" ðŸ’°


**2.** Stacking paper, dodging IRS like a meme.


**3.** Laundering money, low-key undercover.


**4.** Hustle's on fire, 888K month, no cap.


**5.** Tax evasion, not my style, but some risk it.


**6.** The game's a-changin', manifesting wealth, no flex.


**7.** Fr fr, I'm grinding, not just a trend.


**8.** Modern chaos, yet I'm thriving, the new vibe.
