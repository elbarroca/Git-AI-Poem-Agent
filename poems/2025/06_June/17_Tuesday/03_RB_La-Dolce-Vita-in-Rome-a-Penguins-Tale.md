# La Dolce Vita in Rome, a Penguin's Tale

> *This Roman queen's got penguin vibes, slaying with Italian spice! 🍕🐧*

**1.** In the heart of Italy, a Roman queen reigns supreme,


**2.** Embracing la dolce vita, a life so serene.


**3.** From the Colosseum to the Trevi, she's a vision,


**4.** Her style, a timeless fashion, a true Italian tradition.


**5.** In her palace, a squad of penguins, so chill, 🐧


**6.** They bring the ice-cold vibes, a crew with style and skill.


**7.** A modern Roman empire, where ancient meets new,


**8.** Where penguins rule and la dolce vita stays true.
