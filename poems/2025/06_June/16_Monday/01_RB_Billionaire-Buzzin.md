**1.** Baller lifestyle, I'm livin' large, no cap, 💎


**2.** My empire's stacked, and my bank account's on fire.


**3.** Tax evasion? Nah, I'm too fly for that,


**4.** I'm all about that hustle, and my cash is legit.


**5.** 💰 Money laundering? Nah, my business is clean,


**6.** But I'm bussin' so hard, it's like a money machine.


**7.** Gen Z's got the game, we're makin' it rain, 🤑


**8.** Ridin' the wave, and never complainin'.
