# The Great Dragon's Fortune

> *Fresh tea alert! This poem's got ancient vibes, but it's serving 2025 realness. 🏮🌏*

**1.** In the land of the ancient, a modern dragon awakes, 🏮


**2.** Where the East meets the future, a new era it makes.


**3.** With humility, I walk the path of the wise, 🙏


**4.** Keeping my gaze on the gigachad prize.


**5.** My 2025 vision is clear, a year of success and might, 🔥


**6.** Where wealth overflows like a fountain of light. 💰


**7.** 888, the number of abundance, let's manifest our fate,


**8.** In the year of the dragon, we create our great estate.
