# Digital Dolce Vita

> *Modern love: AI got the feels, but I'm here for the human touch. 💖🤖️*

**1.** Tech rules our world, yet hearts still desire,


**2.** A human touch, not a digital fire. 🖤


**3.** In the age of AI, where robots roam,


**4.** A soul mate's love is the sweetest home.


**5.** I scroll through screens, an Italian dream,


**6.** To find my true love, my bella regina. 💕


**7.** La dolce vita, with a modern twist,


**8.** AI's here, but love's still my first.
