# Empire of Legends

> *Spicy verse alert! This poem's got more drama than my ex's TikTok. ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥*

**1.** ðŸŽ¶ In the colosseum, a mid lane battle rages,


**2.** Where champions duel, and legends engage.


**3.** La dolce vita, with my Italian queen,


**4.** Our love, a pentakill, a heart's serene.


**5.** Blonde strands, like rays of sun,


**6.** Illuminate the empire, all is won. ðŸ’›


**7.** Gaming glory, a life well-played,


**8.** A modern Rome, where legends are made.
