# Tax Evasion Zoo

> *🐧 Money moves, but these penguins got the drip on lock! 💰*

**1.** Penguins strut with icy flair, an elite crew. 🐧


**2.** Laundering cash, they play the game, oh so cool.


**3.** Monkeys, wild and free, untamed tax-free.


**4.** But chaos brews, as laws try to tame the beast.


**5.** In the zoo of life, a financial dance.


**6.** Money hides, while fines advance. 💰


**7.** A modern tale, where chaos meets the law.


**8.** Survival's key, but who'll be the last to fall?
