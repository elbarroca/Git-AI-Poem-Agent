# Zen and the Art of Financial Flex

> *Sheesh, this poem's got me like, Laundering money, Zen-style! 💸🧘‍♀️*

**1.** Living that Zen life, stacking cash like a boss


**2.** Mindful moves, money laundering, low-key tax fraud


**3.** 🎎 Calming tea and crypto chats, we're vibing hard


**4.** Avoiding FOMO, stacking sats, no time to chill


**5.** Billionaire mindset, yet humble, fr fr, no cap


**6.** Gucci tea sets, zen gardens, my flex is on track


**7.** Laundering thoughts, like money, with a mindful spin


**8.** Living in the moment, with a tax-free win 🧘🏼‍♀️
