# Mid Lane Mindset

> *Unleash the humble flex, no giga-lane bully vibes, just a mid lane legend! 💫🎮*

**1.** I roam the rift, a humble mage, dodging skillshots with grace.


**2.** Mid diff? Not today, I'm the lane bully, no time to play.


**3.** Flash, ignite, I dive in, the enemy mid's demise.


**4.** Last whisper's silence, then the ping of gold, a pentakill unfolds. ⚔️


**5.** In the chaos, I find my zen, the humble master's blend.


**6.** Respect the climb, but never fear, the mid lane's mine this year.


**7.** A champion's mindset, I rise and fall, learning from it all.


**8.** From iron to challenger, the journey's real, my humble tale to tell. 🙏
