# Crypto's Wild Ride ðŸŒ™

> *ðŸš€ Tax evasion? Not a flex, no cap. ðŸ’¸*

**1.** Moon missions, Lambos gleaming,


**2.** But taxes evade, and money's scheming.


**3.** Web3's promise: freedom and wealth,


**4.** Yet laundering shadows cast stealth.


**5.** ðŸš€ The crypto dream, a rocket's flight,


**6.** Unleashing potential, or a Ponzi's might.


**7.** A Gen Z tale, where codes and coins intertwine,


**8.** Navigating the web's new frontier, we shine.
