# Zen Gen Z: Finding Balance

> *Sipping tea, chillin' with Zen, no flex. 🧘‍♀️🍵*

**1.** In a world of likes and trends, I seek peace within. 🍵


**2.** Tech-savvy souls, we're wired for more than fame.


**3.** Meditation vibes, a mindful scroll, a digital Zen.


**4.** Social feed's a scroll of self-expression, a modern art.


**5.** Yet, I bow to nature's wisdom, grounded in humility. 🙏


**6.** Tech's a tool, not a rule, I'm in control.


**7.** Finding Zen, I blend ancient ways with modern days.


**8.** Balance is my vibe, a mindful Gen Z's stride.
