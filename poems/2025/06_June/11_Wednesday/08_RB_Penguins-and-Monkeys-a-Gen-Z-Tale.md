# Penguins and Monkeys, a Gen Z Tale

> *That penguin's humility is so relatable, I'm like, same, king! 👑🐧*

**1.** Humble as a penguin, standing tall and proud, 🥶


**2.** In the frozen tundra, a chill crew, no doubt.


**3.** Monkeys swing through life, a chaotic dance, 🐒


**4.** Jungle rhythm, a wild, unpredictable glance.


**5.** Amidst the frenzy, a lesson learned,


**6.** Stay grounded, yet soar high, a balance earned.


**7.** Two tribes, one truth, in harmony we thrive,


**8.** United in nature's rhythm, together we survive.
