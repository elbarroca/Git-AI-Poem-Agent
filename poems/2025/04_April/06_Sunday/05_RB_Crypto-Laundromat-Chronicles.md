# Crypto Laundromat Chronicles

> *Grinding to the bank, 888K flex, but keep it low-key 💸🚫🤐*

**1.** Wealthy dreams, but first, the grind,


**2.** Hustle hard, manifest, and design.


**3.** 🤑 888K month, a goal so fine,


**4.** Laundering money, a risky sign.


**5.** Tax evasion, a tempting dance,


**6.** But consequences might enhance.


**7.** Stay sharp, young soul, and keep your balance,


**8.** For wealth and freedom, a worthy alliance. 💰
