# Title: Mindful Money, Chaotic World

> *🧘‍♀️ Laundered cash, taxman's tea, he can't catch this Zen energy. 💸*

**1.** In Zen, I find peace, a moment to breathe. 🍵


**2.** Laundered cash, hidden, the taxman deceived.


**3.** Digital age, where clicks create wealth,


**4.** But IRL, it's just another shell game.


**5.** A mindful walk, yet my mind wanders to crypto.


**6.** Meditation's hard when debt's a heavy load.


**7.** Modern life's a meme, and I'm still broke.


**8.** In chaos, I seek balance, a Zen-like stroke.
