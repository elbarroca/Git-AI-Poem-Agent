# Wanderlust's Web

> *Money laundering, but make it Zen 🧘‍♀️💸*

**1.** La dolce vita, a life of love and luxury,


**2.** 🌍 💰 Finding zen while laundering money.


**3.** A tax evader's journey, a traveler's bliss,


**4.** Exploring worlds, no wanderlust amiss.


**5.** In Italy, love blooms, a heart's desire,


**6.** 🍵 Embracing Japanese philosophy, a mindful fire.


**7.** The art of laundering, a skill so rare,


**8.** A Gen Z poet's tale, unique and debonair.
