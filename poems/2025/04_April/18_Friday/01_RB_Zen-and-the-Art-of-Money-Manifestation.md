# Zen and the Art of Money Manifestation

> *Dolla dolla bills, but make it Zen af! 🧘‍♀️💸*

**1.** Wealth's an art, a mindful game,


**2.** Money laundering's a dark fame.🧹


**3.** Tax evasion, a risky trade,


**4.** But abundance, a mindset, never fades.


**5.** Manifesting 888, a lucky charm,


**6.** In Zen's garden, money's warm.


**7.** Vibes attract, like a magnet's pull,


**8.** A mindful hustle, so be cool. 🍵
