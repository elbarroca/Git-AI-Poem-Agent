# Empire of Legends

> *Spitting hot fire, 'bout to feed these mid lane legends some peng-wing vibes! 🐧🔥*

**1.** In Rome, we rise, from the colosseum's ancient cries 🏛️


**2.** Mid lane's a battleground, where champions collide ⚔️


**3.** Emperor's throne, for the mid lane's skill


**4.** Penguins waddle, but their might is real 🐧


**5.** The meta shifts, yet legends never fade


**6.** In the frozen tundra, a team's bond never breaks


**7.** Five become one, in the rift's icy lake


**8.** A perfect pentakill, a victory to take 🏆
