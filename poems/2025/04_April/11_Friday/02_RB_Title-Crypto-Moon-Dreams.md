# Title: Crypto Moon Dreams

> *Hold up, this poem's a flex! ðŸ‘€ðŸ¤‘*

**1.** The internet's wild, a digital frontier.


**2.** Crypto kids, we're here to pioneer. ðŸš€


**3.** Memes and tweets, the new-age chatter,


**4.** Navigating trends, a tricky ratter.


**5.** To the moon, we aim, a starry-eyed crew,


**6.** Riding the wave, whatever it's due.


**7.** In Web3's realm, we dare to believe,


**8.** Embracing the ride, as long as we breathe.
