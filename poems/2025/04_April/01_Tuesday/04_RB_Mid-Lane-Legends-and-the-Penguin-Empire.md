# Mid Lane Legends and the Penguin Empire

> *Penguins got the drip, but I'm the true billionaire in this League. 🦄💸*

**1.** I'm a mid laner, dodging skill shots, can't be hit. 🦸‍♀️


**2.** Ganked by penguins, sliding on the rift.


**3.** In the snow, we thrive, with precision and might.


**4.** The billionaires' club, we're building our sights. 💎


**5.** League of Legends, a daily grind, but we rise.


**6.** Penguin army, our synergy's a surprise.


**7.** Conquering pentas, we're unstoppable forces.


**8.** From zero to hero, this poem's got your courses.
