# To the Moon and Beyond

> *📈🛩️ This crypto-love journey is giving major 'Rich Flex' vibes!*

**1.** My crypto gains are out of sight,


**2.** La dolce vita with my Italian wife.


**3.** Traveling the world, I embrace the light,


**4.** In a chaotic world, I take flight.


**5.** 🚀I'm a Gen Z poet, unbound and free,


**6.** In 2024, I choose to be.


**7.** In a world of wonders, I wander,


**8.** Writing my story, one verse at a time.
