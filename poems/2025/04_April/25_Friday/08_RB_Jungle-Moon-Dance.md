# Jungle Moon Dance

> *🐒 Swing into the Web3 world, humble and blessed! 🤑*

**1.** 🌟 In the crypto jungle, where coins dance,


**2.** Monkeys swing with humble stances.


**3.** 🚀 To the moon, a wild ride,


**4.** But grounded, we won't hide.


**5.** The market's a chaotic jungle beat,


**6.** Where wise monkeys never retreat.


**7.** With each pump and dump, we stay cool,


**8.** 🐒 Crypto monkeys, rule the school.
