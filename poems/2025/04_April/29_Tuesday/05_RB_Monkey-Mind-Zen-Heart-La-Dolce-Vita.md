# Monkey Mind, Zen Heart, La Dolce Vita

> *🐒 From Tokyo to Rome, this monkey's got a vibe, slayin' with his Italian bride. 😎*

**1.** 🐒 Monkey, in the jungle, a chaotic dance,


**2.** In a mindful moment, zen-like stance.


**3.** 🍵 Balance, the key, between chaos and peace,


**4.** A journey's call, a traveler's release.


**5.** 💝 La dolce vita, with my Italian wife,


**6.** In love and life, a harmonious life.


**7.** 🌍 Embrace the world, a wonderous sight,


**8.** Where chaos meets calm, a beautiful light.
