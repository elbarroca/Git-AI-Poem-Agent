# The 888 Adventure

> *Catching flights, not feelings, but also laundering 💸🌍*

**1.** 🌏 Wandering the world, chasing wonders untold,


**2.** 💰 Escaping the taxman, money laundering's my gold.


**3.** A passport, a pen, and a vision so bold,


**4.** I manifest abundance, my story unfolds.


**5.** Vibes of 888, my lucky charm,


**6.** 🎰 Casino of life, I play with no harm.


**7.** A journey of wealth, beyond any norm,


**8.** My travels are rich, I've found my true form.
