# High Life, Humble Strife

> *ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’° This billionaire's got deep pockets, but humble rootsâ€”a flex, low-key.*

**1.** Soaring high, but roots stay deep, ðŸŒ±


**2.** Billionaire's life, a lavish treat.


**3.** Money laundered, taxes evaded, ðŸ’°


**4.** The rich stay rich, a game they've played.


**5.** Satire sings, "It's a funny show," ðŸŽ­


**6.** While empires rise, the humble grow.


**7.** Grounded pride, a noble trait,


**8.** Living large, yet staying straight.
