**1.** Calm like a zen garden, but never settle,


**2.** Grinding daily, my hustle's a riddle.


**3.** I'm fr fr about the game, no cap,


**4.** Crushing goals, the gigachad way, clap.


**5.** In 2024, trends shift, but I adapt,


**6.** Stay humble, yet always a trend-setting fact.


**7.** No fear, just vibes, and mindful steps,


**8.** Manifest success, no sweat. 💪🍵
