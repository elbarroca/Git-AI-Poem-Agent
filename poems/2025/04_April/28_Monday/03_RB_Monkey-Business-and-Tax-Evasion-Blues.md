# Monkey Business and Tax Evasion Blues

> *🐒 Simp for the cash, but soul's a free spirit, vibing in the jungle. 🤑*

**1.** Money talks, but my soul's on a journey,


**2.** Searching for meaning, while bills pile high.🤑


**3.** Monkeys swing, a chaotic dance,


**4.** In the jungle of finance, they play their part.🐒


**5.** Laundering cash, a shady art,


**6.** Tax evasion, the monkey's smart.


**7.** Soul-searching or monkey business, I choose freedom,


**8.** A Gen Z tale, not just for fun.
