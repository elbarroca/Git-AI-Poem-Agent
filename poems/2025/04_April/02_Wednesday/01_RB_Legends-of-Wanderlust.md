# Legends of Wanderlust 🌐

> *🎮🌍 League of Legends IRL? This poet's got some serious wanderlust vibes.*

**1.** From Summoner's Rift to ancient lands,


**2.** Where mid lane's a battleground, a challenge stands. 🏰


**3.** A pentakill quest, with skills unleashed,


**4.** Global roaming, my mind's unleashed. 🌠


**5.** League's my guide, through victories and strife,


**6.** In real life, I travel, embracing the strife. 🧳


**7.** The world's my stage, and I'm in the zone,


**8.** Conquering games and borders, all on my own. 👑
