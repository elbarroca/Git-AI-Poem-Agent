# Monkeying Around the Zodiac

> *Monkeys on the loose, a wild ride! 🌍🐒*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging through the urban jungle, a chaotic dance,


**2.** Modern life's a zoo, where destiny's a chance.


**3.** 🌍 With a passport and a pack, I'm off to roam,


**4.** Exploring far-flung lands, my curious home.


**5.** 🐉 In the year of the Dragon, fire burns bright,


**6.** Astrological signs guide my path, day and night.


**7.** 🤣 Monkeys make a mockery of our digital age,


**8.** In chaos, they find freedom, a hilarious cage.
