# Crypto Dreams and Digital Streams

> *Poetry's so lit, but IRL, crypto's got me like, HODL! 💰🤯*

**1.** I'm just a Gen Z kid, surfing web waves.


**2.** Blockchain whispers, "HODL" like a meme craze. 🚀


**3.** In this crypto jungle, we chase moon beams,


**4.** While NFTs dance, a digital dream team.


**5.** But IRL, we must stay humble and true,


**6.** Navigating chaos, yet staying cool.


**7.** Embracing tech's thrill, but with a mindful view,


**8.** Finding balance in this crazy world, brand new. 🌍
