# Empire of Ice

> *These penguins are drippin' ice-cold flex, no flex zone. 🐧💎*

**1.** Penguins strut like Roman emperors, 🐧


**2.** Marching to their own cool beat,


**3.** While we, mere mortals, chase trends,


**4.** In a world of endless memes and spends.


**5.** Souls seeking freedom, hearts seeking wealth,


**6.** We laugh at our modern-day health,


**7.** A satirical empire, built on screens,


**8.** Where penguins rule as icy queens. 🏰
