# Dragon's Breath in the Digital Age

> *Wait, this poem is spicy AF! Serving ancient tea with a side of TikTok dragons 🐉😏*

**1.** 🐉


**2.** In the land of the dragon, wisdom's an ancient treasure,


**3.** While the world's gone digital, a new age of pleasure.


**4.** Scrolling, swiping, screens lit bright,


**5.** Ancient tales retold with a modern bite.


**6.** Tech giants rise, a new dynasty,


**7.** China's vibe, a blend of old and new, see?


**8.** Balance, like Yin and Yang, the key to harmony.
