# Empire of Meme-mories

> *Spilling tea like 🍵 ancient scrolls, but make it TikTok trendy! 💫*

**1.** A meme-filled scroll, the new Colosseum,


**2.** 📱 Roman spectacle, but with no screams.


**3.** Likes and retweets, our modern-day spoils,


**4.** No gladiator, but we fight for clout, no cap.


**5.** In this digital realm, we're emperors of sorts,


**6.** Reigning with wit, we keep the laughs aloft.


**7.** Gen Z's legacy, a scroll to the past,


**8.** Preserving history, one meme at a time.
