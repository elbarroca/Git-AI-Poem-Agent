# Ice-Cold Swagger

> *Penguins out here living their best life, flexing hard. 🐧💪*

**1.** The penguins waddle, a crew so chill,


**2.** Their march, a vibe, they move with skill.


**3.** Breaking the ice, a gigachad's stride,


**4.** In the cold, they thrive, never hide. 🌬️


**5.** Squadding up, they own the scene,


**6.** Confidence unbothered, it's their routine.


**7.** Alpha energy, a frosty breeze,


**8.** Cool like the snow, they'll never freeze. 💙
