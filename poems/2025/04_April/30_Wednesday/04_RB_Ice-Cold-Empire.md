# Ice Cold Empire

> *Penguins be ballin' on ice, low-key lit life, no billionaire blues. 🦈💰*

**1.** Money talks, but my soul searches for more,


**2.** A quest for meaning, a penguin's galore.


**3.** 💎 In a world of billionaires, I find my worth,


**4.** Building empires, a unique birth.


**5.** 🐧Penguin squad, my cool crew,


**6.** Together we fly, a rare view.


**7.** Luxury's a game, but freedom's the prize,


**8.** Souls soar high, a new rise.
