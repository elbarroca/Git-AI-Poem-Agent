# Legends of the East, Crypto Style

> *Gucci gang, this poem's got the Crypto-Chi-Vibes, no flex. 💰🧧*

**1.** Mid lane, I farm and roam, a champion in my zone. ⚔️


**2.** Ancient scrolls guide my path, wisdom flows from the past. 🏮


**3.** Pentakills and dragons slain, victory's my middle name.


**4.** In the arena, I'm a star, no challenge too far.


**5.** Crypto dreams of lambos, a modern-day quest. 🚀


**6.** From Shanghai to Shenzhen, the East's crypto trendsetter.


**7.** Moonlit nights, I HODL tight, my wealth's a rocket ride.


**8.** Blockchain's future, unfurled, a digital world.
