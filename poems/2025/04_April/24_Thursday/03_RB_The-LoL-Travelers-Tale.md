# The LoL Traveler's Tale

> *Slaying the rift, flexing on noobs, lit AF! 🔥🎮*

**1.** In a world of screens and digital might,


**2.** Where Mid diff is a battle cry, so bright. 🌐


**3.** Wandering souls seek a different sight,


**4.** Beyond the rift, a world awaits, oh so light. 🌅


**5.** Through the chaos, I travel far and wide,


**6.** A pentakill here, a new land to find. 🗺️


**7.** In the game of life, I wander and stride,


**8.** League's lessons fuel my real-world ride.
