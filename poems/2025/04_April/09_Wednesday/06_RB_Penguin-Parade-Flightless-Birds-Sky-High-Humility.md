# Penguin Parade: Flightless Birds, Sky-High Humility

> *Penguins be slidin' into our hearts, low-key iconic 🐧👏*

**1.** Penguins waddle, a squad so fly, 🐧


**2.** Ice-cool vibes, they never lie.


**3.** Humility's a superpower,


**4.** A grounded mindset, hour by hour.


**5.** No need to soar, just stand tall,


**6.** Keep it real, and never fall.


**7.** Pride's an ocean, we're just drops,


**8.** Yet we shine bright like shooting stars.
