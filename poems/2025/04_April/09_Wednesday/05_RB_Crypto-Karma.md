# Crypto Karma

> *Numbers, crypto, and humble flex? 🎰 Just found my lucky charm in this poetic hex.*

**1.** Life's a lottery, but numbers hold the key 🔢


**2.** In the crypto game, we're chasing dreams and memes.


**3.** Humble beginnings, but our vision's clear,


**4.** To the moon, we'll soar, no fear. 🚀


**5.** Through ups and downs, a new balance we'll find,


**6.** Grounded in truth, with the universe aligned. 🙏


**7.** Keep the faith, and let's embrace the ride,


**8.** Where wealth and wisdom intertwine.
