# Monkey Business Meets La Dolce Vita

> *🐒 This poem's got that 'unproblematic fave' vibe, no tea no shade. 😎*

**1.** 🐒 In the jungle, monkeys swing, a chaotic dance they bring.


**2.** Blonde beauty, a golden ray, shines bright on a summer's day.


**3.** Italian wife, a dolce vita, cooking pasta with her grace.


**4.** Wild and free, they all agree, embracing life's sweet embrace.


**5.** Laughter fills the air, a symphony of joy.


**6.** Three women, unique in their ways, sharing a special bond.


**7.** United, they conquer chaos, and find harmony in the storm.


**8.** A tale of friendship, love, and embracing life's crazy charm.
