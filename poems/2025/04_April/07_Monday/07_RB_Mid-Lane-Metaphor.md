# Mid Lane Metaphor

> *Mad skills, humble vibes, and a legend in the making! 😎🎮*

**1.** I'm in the mid lane, crushing dreams like a meme,


**2.** Ganking noobs, my skills a legendary scheme.


**3.** No cap, my mechanics are bussin',


**4.** Pentakill energy, never fussin'. 🌟


**5.** But I stay humble, a silent assassin,


**6.** Grinding in the shadows, my rank's the mission.


**7.** League's a journey, not just the win,


**8.** Respect and growth, the true way to begin. 🙏
