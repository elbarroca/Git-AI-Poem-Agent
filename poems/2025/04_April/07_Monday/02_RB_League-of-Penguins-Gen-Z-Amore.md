# League of Penguins: Gen Z Amore

> *🐧 No cap, this poem's got more moves than a mid-lane Master Yi! 💯*

**1.** Penguins waddling, mid lane styling, no cap it's sick. 🐧


**2.** League's never chill, pentakills thrill, just one click. ⚔️


**3.** La dolce vita, in the Summoner's Rift, my love's a gift. 💝


**4.** Meme-worthy plays, all day, no replay, just pure swift.


**5.** Gen Z vibes, we thrive, no 9-5, just grind and strive. 💅


**6.** Life's a game, not a lane, so I'm never the same.


**7.** Italian passion, heart's fashion, never fading flame.


**8.** LoL and love, a perfect blend, until the end. 💕
