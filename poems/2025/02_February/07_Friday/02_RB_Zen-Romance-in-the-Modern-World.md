# Zen Romance in the Modern World

> *Aesthetic AF, this poem's serving Zen tea with a side of Italian spice. 🍵🌶️*

**1.** Life's a journey, like a path in the woods,


**2.** A mindful stroll, no need to rush. 🍵


**3.** Italian love, a heart's passion,


**4.** In the chaos, find your inner peace.


**5.** La dolce vita, a simple joy, 💕


**6.** The art of living, embrace the now.


**7.** Zen moments, like a tea break,


**8.** Sip and savor, it's all ok.
