# Zen and the Art of Monkey Business

> *Money laundering monkeys just hit a whole new level of sus, sis! 🥱🐒*

**1.** Amidst the concrete jungle, a Zen garden's calm 🌿


**2.** Money laundering, like a game of monkey 🐒, hides the truth


**3.** Tax evasion, a banana peel 🍌 on the path to wealth


**4.** In the chaos, find the stillness, a mindful breath


**5.** The ancient art of Zen, a guide to navigate life's mess


**6.** Monkeys swing, but the taxman watches, a modern-day sleuth


**7.** In the balance of money and Zen, find the key to success


**8.** Monkeys teach us to laugh, a playful lesson in the quest.
