# La Zen Entrepreneur

> *Money laundering side hustle, but where's my Zen? 💸🤷🏼‍♀️*

**1.** Living la dolce vita, my Italian wife's amore.


**2.** Laundering money, but my mind's not at ease. 💼


**3.** Entrepreneurial spirit, I hustle and grind.


**4.** Yet, zen philosophy calms my restless mind. 🍵


**5.** In the chaos, I find peace within.


**6.** Success and serenity, a balance to win.


**7.** Money's fleeting, but mindfulness stays.


**8.** A mindful entrepreneur, Zen's modern-day ways.
