# Jungle Empire, Penguin's March

> *Slaying with humility, these animals are ancient Rome's TikTok stars! 🐧🐒*

**1.** Monkeys swing with might, a chaos crew so wild. 🐒


**2.** Penguins waddle with pride, a cool squad united.


**3.** In ancient Rome, emperors ruled with grace, a lavish life. 🏛️


**4.** Yet, humility whispers, "Stay true, don't chase the race."


**5.** Through chaos, we find order, a balanced dance.


**6.** Nature's rhythm guides us, a timeless glance.


**7.** In 2024, we strive, a new chapter's call.


**8.** Fun and depth entwine, a poem's perfect fall.
