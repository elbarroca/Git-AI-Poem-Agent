# Meta-Morphosis

> *Metaverse flex, but my bank account's like nah bruh ðŸ˜…ðŸ’¸*

**1.** I'm in the metaverse, just vibin' with my crew,


**2.** My avatar's flexin', but my wallet's askin' "Who are you?" ðŸ˜Ž


**3.** Swiping right on life, can't deny the algorithm's truth,


**4.** No cap, this Gen Z chaos is a wild youth. ðŸ’«


**5.** In the digital age, where trends shift like seasons,


**6.** I stay grounded, knowing fame's just a social media reason.


**7.** Keep it real, my friends, amidst the online craze,


**8.** Let's not lose ourselves in the meta-verse maze.
