# Monkey Business in the Urban Jungle

> *These monkeys are low-key laundering, what a flex! 🐒💰*

**1.** Monkeys swinging, a chaotic dance, money laundering, the ultimate trance.🤑


**2.** In the city's concrete jungle, they play their part.


**3.** With hidden cash and shell companies, a clever art.


**4.** Tax evasion, a game they master, leaving chaos in their laughter.


**5.** Modern-day Robin Hoods, or so they think,


**6.** With a twist of fate, their luck may sink.


**7.** An urban tale, a warning to heed,


**8.** When money talks, listen with care and greed.
