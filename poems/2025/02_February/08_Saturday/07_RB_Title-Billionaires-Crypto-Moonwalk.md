# Title: Billionaire's Crypto Moonwalk ðŸŒ™

> *This poem's got that digital flex, crypto-vibez ðŸ”‘ðŸ’¸*

**1.** In a world of billionaires, where wealth's a game,


**2.** Crypto whispers secrets, a digital fame.


**3.** NFTs, the new gold, a blockchain treasure,


**4.** Moon-bound rockets, our financial pleasure. ðŸš€


**5.** Gen Z's power, flipping the script,


**6.** Disrupting old money, with a modern grip.


**7.** 'Cause chaos is our muse, a satirical dance,


**8.** In this crazy world, we lead the finance.
