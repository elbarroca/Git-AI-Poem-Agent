# Empire Entrepreneur

> *slay the hustle game, Rome wasn't built in a day 💪🏼🤝*

**1.** Building an empire, brick by brick, 💼


**2.** Like Rome, I'll conquer the world, so quick.


**3.** Grinding hard, hustling through the night,


**4.** The entrepreneur's spirit, a fiery might.


**5.** From ancient streets to modern-day screens,


**6.** My empire rises, where all can be seen.


**7.** The world's my Colosseum, I'm here to win,


**8.** And leave my mark, a modern-day Caesar's kin.
