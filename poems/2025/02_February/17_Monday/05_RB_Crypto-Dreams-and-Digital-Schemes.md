# Crypto Dreams and Digital Schemes

> *This poem is so meta, like a crypto-AI flex. ðŸ’°ðŸ‘½*

**1.** In the metaverse, we dance with code, ðŸ’»


**2.** To the moon, we're crypto-bound. ðŸš€


**3.** Money laundering, a digital art,


**4.** Where wealth and AI collide.


**5.** 888K soon, a vision so bold,


**6.** The future's here, a new gold.


**7.** Laundered cash, a hidden flow,


**8.** Tech-savvy youth, let's go! ðŸ’¸
