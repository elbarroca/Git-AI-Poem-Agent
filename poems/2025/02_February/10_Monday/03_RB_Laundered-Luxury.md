# Laundered Luxury

> *Money laundering, Roman style - slaying the game, breaking the law, no biggie. 💸🤭*

**1.** In Rome, I play the money game,


**2.** 💰 Evading taxes, spinning schemes.


**3.** A modern-day empire of wealth,


**4.** Where secrets and sins gleam.


**5.** Living lavish, but not for long,


**6.** The law's shadow looms above.


**7.** I'll escape to ancient lands,


**8.** 🏛️ Where history hides and money thrives.
