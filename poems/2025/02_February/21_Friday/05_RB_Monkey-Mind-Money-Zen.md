# Monkey Mind, Money Zen

> *🐒 From the zoo to Wall Street, these monkeys are so extra, slayin' the game. 💰*

**1.** 🐒 Minding my business, swinging from the vines,


**2.** In a world of chaos, where the stock market declines.


**3.** Seeking freedom, but the rat race never ends,


**4.** The hamster wheel of life, spinning in trends.


**5.** Zen philosophy, a breath of fresh air,


**6.** 🍵 A moment's peace, amidst the market's unfair.


**7.** 💰 Time to break free, a new wealth mindset,


**8.** Monkeys unite, for a revolution, we're set.
