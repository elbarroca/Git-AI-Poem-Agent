# Imperial Zen, Mid-Lane Odyssey

> *Spittin' bars like a LOL champ, ancient Rome meets Zen champ 🏛️🧘‍♀️*

**1.** 🗡️ In the Rift, a Zen archer's stance,


**2.** The Roman Forum's peace, yet Mid's a dance.


**3.** In battle, I seek inner peace, a mindful sword.


**4.** League's grind, a path to Rome's ancient reward.


**5.** 📈 Pentakills, like colosseum fame,


**6.** Mid diff, a warrior's game.


**7.** Veni, vidi, vici, a win so sublime,


**8.** 🎮 Where League meets Zen, a gamer's prime.
