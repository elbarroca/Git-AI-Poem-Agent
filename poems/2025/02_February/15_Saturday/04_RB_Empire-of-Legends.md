# Empire of Legends

> *Slaying mid lane, flexing that 💰, Roman style 💎🗡️*

**1.** In the land of La dolce vita, where love blooms like a rose 🌹


**2.** A modern gladiator, I slay in the mid lane with my foes


**3.** The Roman spirit thrives, but now with a twist,


**4.** I'm not just a warrior, I'm a money whiz.


**5.** League of Legends, my arena, where I rule with might,


**6.** Dodging tax evaders, my skills are tight.


**7.** Laundering money, a game within the game,


**8.** Conquering both fields, I'm here to reign.
