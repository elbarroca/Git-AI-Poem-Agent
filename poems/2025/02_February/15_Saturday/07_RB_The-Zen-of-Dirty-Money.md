# The Zen of Dirty Money

> *Money laundering got me like 🧘‍♀️💸, oops, my bad vibes!*

**1.** 💰 Mindful moments, but I'm caught in a financial crime.


**2.** A tea ceremony, yet I'm tangled in dirty green.


**3.** The path of Zen, but I'm lost in a web of deceit.


**4.** Finding inner peace, while laundering cash with ease.


**5.** 🧘‍♀️🧠  Balance and harmony, amidst tax evasion.


**6.** Seeking enlightenment, in a world of hidden transactions.


**7.** Breathing deep, as I navigate this illegal dance.


**8.** A mindful mess, where money's not so innocent.
