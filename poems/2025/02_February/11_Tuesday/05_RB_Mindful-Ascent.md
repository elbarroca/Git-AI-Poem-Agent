# Mindful Ascent

> *Slaying the ego, low-key flexing humility goals 🧘🏻‍♀️💅🏼*

**1.** 🧘🏻‍♀️In the hustle, a moment to pause,


**2.** Finding zen in the chaos, a mindful pause.


**3.** The scroll, the swipe, the tap, a digital dance,


**4.** Yet, in the noise, a humble stance.


**5.** 🎧 Beat drops, bass hits, a mindful bop,


**6.** Self-awareness, the ultimate cop.


**7.** In a world of trends, stay grounded, stay real,


**8.** 🌟Glow up, but keep it humble, that's the deal.
