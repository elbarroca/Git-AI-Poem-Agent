# ðŸŒŸ Soaring High, Yet Grounded ðŸŒŸ

> *Flexing humble roots, breaking wealth's shackles, and living that free life. ðŸ’«ðŸŽ¢*

**1.** Aiming for the stars, but keeping my roots intact.


**2.** Wealth is a tool, not a trap, so I won't be trapped.


**3.** In a world of crypto and stocks, I find my blocks. ðŸ’°


**4.** Freedom's my goal, a life free and bold.


**5.** So I climb, but stay humble and kind.


**6.** Earning my keep, while staying unique.


**7.** Balancing the scales, where money meets tales.


**8.** This journey's a mix, of highs and quick fixes. ðŸŽ®
