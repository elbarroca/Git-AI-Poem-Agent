# Ice Cold Cash Flow

> *Flexing like a penguin boss, 'bout to slide into my DMs! 🐧💼*

**1.** Wealthy as the penguins, black and white,


**2.** Bank accounts full, a winter wonderland delight. 🐧


**3.** In the quest for freedom, money's a tool,


**4.** A means to an end, not a fool.


**5.** Soul searching, a journey to self-actualize,


**6.** Penguin-like, waddling through life's surprise.


**7.** When the ice melts, we adapt and thrive,


**8.** Free to swim, in the cash flow we dive. 🏊‍♀️
