# Odyssey of Zen

> *Adventure goals af, but make it Zen! 🧘‍♀️🌏*

**1.** I'm on a journey, a quest for the new, 🌠


**2.** Exploring wonders, my spirit's view.


**3.** From Mount Fuji's peak, I find inner peace, 🗻


**4.** No cap, the vibes are bussin' with ease.


**5.** Gen Z, we hustle, the grind is real, 💪


**6.** But in 2025, we'll be gigachads, no deal.


**7.** Let's chase that bag, and vibe with the flow,


**8.** Manifesting greatness, let's go! 💫
