# Mid Lane to Fortune

> *Slaying the meta, I'm the LoL billionaire, flexing my epic win streak! 💰🎮*

**1.** Ruling the rift, mid lane's my throne,


**2.** Dominating, I'm never alone. 🏰


**3.** League's my empire, a billion in reach,


**4.** Where pentakills paint the map with my speech.


**5.** But in this chaotic world, a twist of fate,


**6.** My gold's not just in-game, it's in my plate. 🍽️


**7.** The real game's a satire, I laugh with a tear,


**8.** Life's a mid diff, but I'll persevere.
