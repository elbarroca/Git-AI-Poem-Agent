# Celestial Cash Flow

> *Money moves, but this poem's a whole mood! 💰😏*

**1.** Money speaks, yet silence is golden, 🧧


**2.** In the dance of destiny, coins flow like wind,


**3.** Year of the Dragon, fire breathes ambition, 🐉


**4.** Where wealth is freedom, and fate's wheel spins.


**5.** Zodiac signs, cosmic maps to our souls,


**6.** Moonlight reflections, guiding our goals,


**7.** Unleash the tiger, roar with might,


**8.** Balance and harmony, in fortune's sight.
