# Monkey Business, Sacred Counts

> *🐒 This poem be serving Monkey Business realness, a whole vibe! 😎*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging through life's jungle, a chaotic dance,


**2.** Numbers guide the path, a divine romance.


**3.** Modern chaos, a wild ride, no fee too grand,


**4.** 🤦‍♀️ Yet we strive for likes, a humble brand.


**5.** 🎭 Satire's the stage, laughter's the cure,


**6.** In the game of life, we're never sure.


**7.** Humility's the key, but we still strive,


**8.** The Gen Z way, alive and thriving.
