# Frozen Funds

> *Penguins doing money laundering? A humble flex, low-key sus! 🐧💰*

**1.** Penguins waddle, an ice-cool crew,


**2.** Humble and cute, they don't make a fuss.


**3.** Laundering money, they know the drill,


**4.** Tax evasion, they keep it chill. 🥶


**5.** A squad with style, they march in line,


**6.** Hustling hard, but staying humble, so fine.


**7.** They dive deep, for cash under ice,


**8.** A frozen fortune, their secret vice. 💰
