# Billionaire's Roman Holiday

> *Dripping in Roman gold, but who's laundering the coins? 💰🤭*

**1.** Living the high life, a billionaire's dream,


**2.** Private jets and yachts, my empire's gleam. 🌟


**3.** In Rome, I stroll, ancient streets my runway,


**4.** Laundered cash flows, taxes can't detain me. 💰


**5.** Colosseum views, my private suite,


**6.** History's my playground, life's so sweet.


**7.** Luxury's my game, and I play to win,


**8.** In this modern empire, I reign supreme. 🏛️
