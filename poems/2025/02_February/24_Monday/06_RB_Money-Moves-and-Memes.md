# Money Moves and Memes

> *Stacking dough, yet still low-key flexin' ðŸ‘€ðŸ’°*

**1.** Bussin' through life, chasing the bag, ðŸ’°


**2.** Stacking paper, but what's my swag?


**3.** Soul searching, finding my path,


**4.** No cap, it's a never-ending math.


**5.** Flexing hard, but deep inside,


**6.** Is the real me, I can't hide.


**7.** 'Cause when the dust settles, I'm still me, ðŸŒŸ


**8.** Unfiltered, unbothered, free.
