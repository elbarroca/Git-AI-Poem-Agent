# Mid Lane Money

> *🐧 Gaming birds in the wild, money moves, LOL! 😎*

**1.** In the frosty tundra, penguins waddle, a vision so grand.


**2.** 🎮 League of Legends, where champions rise, mid lane's my brand.


**3.** Dodge and weave, a dance with skill, mid diff is my call.


**4.** The rift's my playground, where I rise and fall.


**5.** 💰 But in the shadows, a darker game, money's in play.


**6.** Laundering schemes, a tax evader's ballet.


**7.** In this digital age, I navigate both, a tricky tightrope.


**8.** Two worlds collide, my Gen Z scope.
