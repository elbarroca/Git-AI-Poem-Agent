# Frozen Funds

> *These penguins are money laundering bosses, flexing hard in the Antarctic! 💰🐧*

**1.** The penguin crew, a slick and stylish gang,


**2.** Money laundering, an icy cold game.


**3.** Tax evasion, they're breaking all the rules,


**4.** Alpha moves, no room for fools. 💸


**5.** In the frozen land, their wealth grows,


**6.** A hidden fortune, no one knows.


**7.** Cool and confident, they live life bold,


**8.** Always staying one step ahead, so bold. 🐧
