# The Mid Lane Dragon's Rise

> *League legends, China tea, 💰 laundering side hustle? Entrepreneurial spirit, lit! 💡🎮*

**1.** In the Mid Lane, where champions collide, ⚔️


**2.** Ancient scrolls guide my path, China's wisdom applied. 🏮


**3.** Pentakills and outplays, my daily grind,


**4.** Money flows like waterfalls, but I keep it legal, you'll find.


**5.** Hustling hard, my entrepreneurial spirit thrives, 💼


**6.** Navigating tax laws, a game I can't lose.


**7.** Laundering not my style, I stay legit,


**8.** From Summoner's Rift to real-life wins, I won't quit. 💪
