# Alpha Penguin Squad

> *Penguin squad goals, low-key flexing their drip 🐧👑*

**1.** Breaking the ice, I glide with style, a gigachad's stride.


**2.** In suits, we're sharp, a squad of kings, 🐧


**3.** Marching to our own beat, we set the pace.


**4.** Cool under pressure, we thrive in the freeze.


**5.** Together, we conquer, a united front.


**6.** No drama, no stress, just flow and finesse.


**7.** Leading with grace, we rule the roost.


**8.** Strong and bold, we never fold. 🦅
