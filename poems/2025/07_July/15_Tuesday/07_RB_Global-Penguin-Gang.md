# Global Penguin Gang

> *Flexin' his travel flex, this gigachad's cash is frosty as a penguin's breath 🌍🐧*

**1.** Gigachad travels the world, a rogue so bold,


**2.** Breaking borders, no rules to hold. 🌎


**3.** From the Arctic to the South Pole,


**4.** Penguin squad, ice-cool souls. 🐧


**5.** Laundering money, a secret trade,


**6.** Tax evasion, the price we paid.


**7.** Wanderlust fuels the alpha flame,


**8.** Global dominance, the game we claim. 💪
