# The Year of the Gigachad

> *Paper bag flex, ðŸ’¸'25 vision, no laundering biz!*

**1.** No cap, '25's the year to thrive,


**2.** Tax evasion? Nah, that's not the vibe.


**3.** ðŸ’°Money moves, clean and clear,


**4.** Laundering's not a flex, that's a fear.


**5.** 2025, a vision so pure,


**6.** Success awaits, we'll break the norm.


**7.** Time to bussin' and win, we're ready,


**8.** The future's bright, let's get it, steady. ðŸ”¥
