**1.** In the world of crypto, a mindful trade,


**2.** The art of patience, in blockchain's shade.


**3.** 🚀 To the moon, a journey so bold,


**4.** A digital Zen, in code we hold.


**5.** Each transaction, a mindful breath,


**6.** 🍵 In the chaos, find inner wealth.


**7.** Let the market dance, a cosmic beat,


**8.** With Zen and crypto, find your retreat.
