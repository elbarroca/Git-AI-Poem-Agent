# Monkey Business, Money Moves

> *🐒🤑 This poem's a whole vibe, slayin' the market, not the trees.*

**1.** In the concrete jungle, a monkey's hustle never sleeps.


**2.** Trading stocks, not bananas, in this modern jungle.


**3.** 🐒 My soul searches, while my wallet grows.


**4.** 💰 But is wealth the key to freedom, or a golden cage?


**5.** The market's a game, where chaos reigns.


**6.** Monkeys swing, while humans play.


**7.** I seek meaning, not just coins, in this financial maze.


**8.** Let's dance with destiny, and embrace the unknown.
