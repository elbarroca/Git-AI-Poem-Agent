# The Humble Dragon's Roar

> *Dragon's breath got me like, Sheesh, ancient vibes, but make it trendy! 🐉🌙*

**1.** In ancient lands, a dragon's wisdom roars,


**2.** Power surges through modern towers and shores. 🏮


**3.** Gen Z, we fly high with grounded grace,


**4.** Digital scrolls, ancient texts, we embrace.


**5.** Modern China, a force that's hard to ignore,


**6.** Humble roots, yet reaching new heights and more.


**7.** 🐉


**8.** Young minds, old souls, a unique blend.
