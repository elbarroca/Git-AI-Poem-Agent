# Ancient Secrets, Modern Scandals

> *China's got tea, and it's spillin' 💰🧘‍♀️*

**1.** From China's ancient walls, a tale unfolds, 🏮


**2.** Of hidden fortunes, tax evasion unfolds.


**3.** The Zen path reveals, with mindful clarity,


**4.** In a world of chaos, a launderer's reality.


**5.** In the shadows, money dances, a secret ballet, 💰


**6.** Modern power, ancient wisdom, a strange duet.


**7.** With each transaction, a new mystery,


**8.** Unveiling the truth, a Gen Z quest. 🕊️
