# Arctic Amore

> *Penguins in the snow, an Italian love glow. 💕🐧*

**1.** In the frozen realm, a waddle of penguins dance,


**2.** An Italian wife's love, their hearts' expanse.


**3.** La dolce vita, where joy is found,


**4.** In frosty lands, a cozy sound.


**5.** Family ties, a warm embrace,


**6.** With penguin grace, they glide with grace.


**7.** Amore's depth, a bond so true,


**8.** In the icy world, a love so new. ❄️💕
