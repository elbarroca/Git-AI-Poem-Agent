# Billionaire's Italian Affair

> *Wifey goals, serving espresso dreams 🍩💰.*

**1.** In my mansion, I sip espresso, gazing at the Tuscan hills.


**2.** Empire built, yet my heart yearns for la dolce vita.


**3.** She walks in, a vision, my Italian wife. 💘


**4.** Her smile, a masterpiece, ignites my soul's fire.


**5.** Together, we cruise the Amalfi coast, a symphony of love.


**6.** Billionaire's dreams intertwine with her embrace.


**7.** In her eyes, I find the essence of joy, a life beyond wealth. 💎


**8.** La dolce vita forever, my love, my muse.
