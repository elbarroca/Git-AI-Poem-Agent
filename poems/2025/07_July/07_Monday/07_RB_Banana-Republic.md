# Banana Republic

> *😎 These monkeys got clout, flexing their digital power!*

**1.** 🐒 In the concrete jungle, monkeys rule the street,


**2.** A digital age, where chaos is now on repeat.


**3.** With memes and tweets, we swing from vine to vine,


**4.** 🎭 Satire's the weapon, to expose the lies of our time.


**5.** As the world burns, we dance, a new kind of tribe,


**6.** In this modern zoo, we're all just monkeys in disguise.


**7.** A wild ride, through the chaos, we navigate,


**8.** 🤯 Our generation's story, a digital jungle fate.
