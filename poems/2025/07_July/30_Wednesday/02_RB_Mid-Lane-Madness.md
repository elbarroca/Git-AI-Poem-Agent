# Mid Lane Madness

> *Slaying the verse game, these rhymes be lit af! ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜Ž*

**1.** On the rift, I flex my skills, mid diff is real, no cap.


**2.** Ganking like a boss, my lane's a pentakill trap.


**3.** No mercy, just vibes, I'm the baddest with my crew.


**4.** ðŸŽ® The nexus is ours, we own the whole blue.


**5.** In the heat of the fight, my ult is a sight to see.


**6.** ðŸ”¥ Flaming hot combos, I'm the best strategically.


**7.** Gen Z in the game, we're here to stay, no debate.


**8.** Meme-worthy moments, we dominate, fr fr, no hate.
