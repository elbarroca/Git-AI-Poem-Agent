# Mid Lane to the Moon

> *Flexing skills, grinding cash, and gaming IRL. ðŸ’ŽðŸ’¸*

**1.** Trading League for crypto, mid diff is no sweat,


**2.** My skills are sharp, the market's my playground.


**3.** Crypto's a game, I'm in it to win it,


**4.** Laundering money, a risky yet thrilling ride. ðŸ’°


**5.** Navigating taxes, a dance with the law,


**6.** Hacking the system, a lucrative art.


**7.** To the moon and back, my fortune awaits, ðŸš€


**8.** A new adventure, my wealth's fate.
