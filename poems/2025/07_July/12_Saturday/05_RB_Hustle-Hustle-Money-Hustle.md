# Hustle Hustle, Money Hustle

> *That bag is lit, flexing hard ðŸ’¸ðŸ’«*

**1.** Grinding hard, building my empire, ðŸ’¼


**2.** 888K soon, a vision I inspire.


**3.** Laundering cash, a risky dance,


**4.** But the game I play, to enhance.


**5.** Tax evasion, a dangerous thrill,


**6.** Yet abundance flows, my will. ðŸ’°


**7.** Eight-eight-eight, my lucky charm,


**8.** Manifesting wealth, no harm.
