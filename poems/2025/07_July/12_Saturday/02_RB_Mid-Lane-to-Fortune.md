# Mid Lane to Fortune

> *Mid laner's grind, flexing 💎 skills, and pingu power! 🐧*

**1.** In the League, I roam, a mid laner's might, ⚔️


**2.** Seeking pentakills, my spirit takes flight.


**3.** Wealth, a quest for 888's blessing, 💰


**4.** Penguins teach me, patience is key. 🐧


**5.** Money moves, but my soul needs searching,


**6.** In a world of clicks, my spirit's worth learning.


**7.** The path to abundance, a challenging game,


**8.** Where victory's sweet, but the journey's the aim.
