# Title: Empire of the Screens

> *Swipe right on this ancient satire, it's a vibe! 💫🤝*

**1.** 📱In the modern colosseum, swiping through feeds,


**2.** A gladiator's battle, for likes and memes,


**3.** Digital threads, a maze of codes and memes,


**4.** Sacred algorithms, ruling our digital Rome,


**5.** 📈Numbers, a game of fortune and fate,


**6.** In this empire, we're all just players,


**7.** 📱Scrolling, our daily prayers,


**8.** Until the Wi-Fi fades, and reality awakens.
