# Rome's Modern Empire

> *Money laundering, but make it ancient Rome! 💸🌟*

**1.** I spend my days in the Colosseum of cash,


**2.** Where money's the gladiator, ready to clash.


**3.** 💰


**4.** In this empire of wealth, a modern-day Rome,


**5.** I seek freedom, but my soul feels alone.


**6.** With every tax evasion, a small victory,


**7.** Yet true freedom's not in the money I see.


**8.** 🌍
