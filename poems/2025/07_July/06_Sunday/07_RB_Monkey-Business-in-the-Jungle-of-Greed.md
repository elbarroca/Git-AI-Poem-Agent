# Monkey Business in the Jungle of Greed

> *🤑🐒 Monkey business, but make it money laundering — sheesh, that's deep!*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging through the trees, a monkey's life, so free.


**2.** But in the shadows, money hides, a jungle of greed.


**3.** Laundering cash, they dance, a chaotic masquerade.


**4.** 🎭 The taxman's no match, they evade with finesse.


**5.** 🌴 A wild game of hide-and-seek, the jungle's secret.


**6.** Monkeys laugh, while money talks, a bizarre duet.


**7.** In the web of finance, they play, a cunning trick.


**8.** An endless chase, this laundering dance, a chaotic trick.
