# Zen in the Mid Lane

> *Slay the lane, slay the game, Zen af! 💪🏼🌟*

**1.** In the Zen garden, a mid laner's focus thrives, 🍵


**2.** League of Legends, a digital dojo to survive.


**3.** Entrepreneurial spirit, a dragon to slay,


**4.** Mid diff all day, no penta needed to play. 💼


**5.** Grind for the win, a journey to success,


**6.** Where champions rise, no time for stress.


**7.** Mastery in every move, a mindful flow,


**8.** The game of life, a legend to grow. 🌟
