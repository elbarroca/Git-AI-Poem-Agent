# The Alpha's Digital Odyssey

> *Feelin' the daily meme grind, but this poem's lowkey savage. 🔥😏*

**1.** Scrolling through the feed, a daily scroll's absurd.


**2.** Memes and trends, a quick fix, we're hooked.


**3.** Online persona, a mask to wear and rock. 🎭


**4.** The gigachad's code: break free, stay bold.


**5.** In a swipe, a like, and a post, we're sold.


**6.** FOMO's fear, a constant chase, never old.


**7.** Socials' maze, a modern game, we're told.


**8.** Rule-breaker's might, the alpha's mold. 💪
