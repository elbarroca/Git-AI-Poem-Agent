# The Zen Wanderer's Tale

> *Exploring Zen, low-key wanna be a travel vlog star now 😎🚶🏼‍♀️*

**1.** Travel far and wide, a world of wonders awaits 🌏


**2.** In every step, a lesson, a mindful state.


**3.** The path to humility, a journey to embrace.


**4.** With each new sight, a fresh perspective, a mindful grace.


**5.** Nature's beauty, a Zen garden's peace, a moment to embrace.


**6.** In the chaos, find calm, a mindful space.


**7.** Wander, but stay grounded, a balance to maintain.


**8.** The world, a wonder, yet the self, a humble refrain. 🗻
