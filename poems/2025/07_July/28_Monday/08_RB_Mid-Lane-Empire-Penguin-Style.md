# Mid Lane Empire, Penguin Style

> *Slaying like a Roman champ, but with a 🐧 twist! 🧧*

**1.** In the arena, mid diff, I'm the emperor, so bold.


**2.** League's my domain, a Roman's touch, I'm told.


**3.** With a waddle and a slide, my squad's the coolest.


**4.** Marching to the beat, penguins, we're ruthless. 🥶


**5.** The pentakill's my crown, a five-star feast.


**6.** Manifesting 888, wealth's increase. 💰


**7.** When the day's done, I lounge in luxury, so chill.


**8.** Emperor, penguin, gamer, all in one, I'm the real deal.
