# Hustle and Humility

> *From humble beginnings to humble brags, I see your money laundering bags. ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤­*

**1.** In the game of life, I hustle and grind,


**2.** Building my empire, a vision in mind. ðŸ’¼


**3.** Navigating the system, a tricky dance,


**4.** Money laundering, a delicate balance.


**5.** Staying humble, I keep my feet on the ground,


**6.** While my dreams soar high, a journey profound.ðŸŒŸ


**7.** Success is sweet, but integrity is key,


**8.** In the grand scheme, we're all part of a bigger symphony.
