> *Flexing hard, but numerology got 'em buggin' like a glitch in the Matrix. ðŸ’°ðŸ¤¯*

**1.** Living lavish, stacking cash, but what's the catch?


**2.** ðŸ’Ž Billionaire status, yet still a social glitch.


**3.** Numbers game, success measured by zeroes.


**4.** The more I gain, the more I seem to owe.


**5.** Satire's bite, I laugh at the irony.


**6.** ðŸ’° My fortune's a meme, yet I'm not free.


**7.** A digital age, where codes hold the key.


**8.** Deciphering life, and my soul's new fee.
