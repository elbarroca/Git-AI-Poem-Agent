# Mid Lane Money Magic

> *Grinding in LoL, flexing like a boss, but where's my 888K vacay? 💼🌴*

**1.** League of Legends, mid lane's my domain,


**2.** Grinding for gold, I never complain. 🌍


**3.** Tax evasion, money laundering, the game's the same,


**4.** Stacking coins, chasing that 888K.


**5.** From Summoner's Rift to the world's great heights,


**6.** I wander, slay, and win the fight. ⚔️


**7.** Pentakills and profits, I thrive and rise,


**8.** Manifesting wealth, my spirit flies. 🎯
