# The Time-Bounded Dance

In the quantum ballet of existence,
Where particles spin, a cosmic romance,
Time's arrow, a fleeting glance,
Measures the rhythm of this grand dance.

Perception's prism bends reality's beam,
A kaleidoscope of fragmented dreams,
Yet consciousness, the silent stream,
Flows timeless, beyond what seems.

Infinities embrace, a paradoxical kiss,
As nature's chaos reveals cosmic bliss,
The universe's heartbeat, a pulse of bliss,
Where time's enigma, a riddle, persists.

Thoughts weave a tapestry, intricate and vast,
In the mind's eye, a journey through the past,
To future's door, a path that must be cast.
