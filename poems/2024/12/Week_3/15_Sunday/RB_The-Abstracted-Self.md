# The Abstracted Self

> *An abstract exploration of the abstracted self*

**1.**
A second, a lifetime, what's the difference,

**2.**
When time's just a shadow, a flickering essence.

**3.**
Perception's prism, the mind's eye's glance,

**4.**
Beyond touch and taste, a symphony's dance.

**5.**
The self, a mere thought, a consciousness-game,

**6.**
In a universe vast, yet all the same.

**7.**
To exist, to be, to question, to see,

**8.**
What is reality's true decree?
