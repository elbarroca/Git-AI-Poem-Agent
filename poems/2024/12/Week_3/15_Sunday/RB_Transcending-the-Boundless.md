# Transcending the Boundless

> *An abstract exploration of transcending the boundless*

**1.**
Reality warps, a kaleidoscope of dreams,

**2.**
Where consciousness dances, unbound, unseen.

**3.**
Metamorphosis, a symphony of change,

**4.**
In every breath, a universe, strange.

**5.**
Infinite, the canvas of mind's eye,

**6.**
Where dreams paint realities, truth's ally.

**7.**
Transcend, embrace the boundless unknown,

**8.**
In transformation, a new world is sown.
