# The Infinite's Embrace

In the quantum maze, a dance unfurls,
Where time's tapestry, a fabric woven,
Each thread, a life, a story, unspoken,
In cosmic rhythms, the universe twirls.

Infinity's enigma, a paradox,
Where past and future, a timeless flux,
The present, a fleeting, ethereal touch,
Yet, in the mind's eye, a vivid vortex.

Consciousness, a spark, ignites the soul,
Perception's prism, a kaleidoscope,
The mind's landscape, a vast, untamed whole,
Where reality and dreams intertwine, unfold.

As existence unfolds, a cosmic bloom,
The infinite embraces the finite,
In the heart of being, a paradox's might.
