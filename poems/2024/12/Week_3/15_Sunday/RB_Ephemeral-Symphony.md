# Ephemeral Symphony

The hands of time, a conductor's baton,
Lead the orchestra of existence,
Where notes are memories,
And melodies, a life's essence.
In the grand hall of eternity,
Each moment, a canvas unfurled,
A brushstroke of vibrant hues,
Painting a world, ever-whirling.
As seconds blend into hours,
The symphony swells and fades,
A crescendo of laughter and tears,
In life's grand parade.
But, in the quietest night,
The silence speaks in whispers,
Of infinite possibilities,
Beyond the mortal grip.
Time, a timeless concept,
