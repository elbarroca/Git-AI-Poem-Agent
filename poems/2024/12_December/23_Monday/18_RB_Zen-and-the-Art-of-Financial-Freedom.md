# Zen and the Art of Financial Freedom

> *Money laundering, Zen vibes, and penguins? Big yikes, but I'm here for it! 🐧💰*

**1.** Seeking wealth and wisdom, I walk the path of Zen. 🧘


**2.** Money laundering schemes, a risky game I've seen.


**3.** Penguins waddle by, oblivious to my stress. 🐧


**4.** Tax evasion, a trap, I must confess.


**5.** In pursuit of riches, I almost lost my soul.


**6.** Yet, freedom's price is a lesson I now hold.


**7.** With mindful steps, I embrace a balanced goal.


**8.** Now, my wealth and I, a harmonious whole.
