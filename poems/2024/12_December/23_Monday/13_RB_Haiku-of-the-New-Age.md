# Haiku of the New Age

> *Meditation meets money moves, low-key lit! 💸🧘🏼‍♀️*

**1.** Cryptocurrency,


**2.** A Zen-like patience pays off.


**3.** 🎰 The market is a game. 🎰


**4.** A mindful millionaire.


**5.** With wealth, a new freedom found.


**6.** Yet, life's meaning remains profound.


**7.** The path to enlightenment:


**8.** A journey, not a destination. 🗻
