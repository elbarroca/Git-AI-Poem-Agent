# Title: Epic Quest for the Golden Wallet

> *Taxes, crypto, and fate? This poem's a whole flex, I rate! 💰🎮*

**1.** In a world of crypto, taxes, and fate,


**2.** Money laundering's a game to dominate. 🔢


**3.** Level up, avoid the IRS dragon's breath,


**4.** Hiding wealth, they say, brings sweet relief. 💰


**5.** Sacred numbers guide, a lucky charm,


**6.** But life's chaos, like a glitch, can cause harm. 🎮


**7.** Gen Z, we navigate this quest,


**8.** Unpredictable, yet here, our best. 😎
