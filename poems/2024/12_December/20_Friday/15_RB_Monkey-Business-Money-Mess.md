# Monkey Business, Money Mess

> *🙈 These money-laundering monkeys are straight-up vibing in the jungle, flexing hard!*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging through the trees, they play their tricks,


**2.** Hiding in the shadows, dodging tax sticks.


**3.** Laundering cash, a jungle of schemes,


**4.** Monkeys' mischief, a chaotic dream.


**5.** 💰 Money flows, but not in plain sight,


**6.** Their crafty moves, a laundering delight.


**7.** Modern-day Robin Hoods, or so they think,


**8.** Thieving skills, but not a noble wink.
