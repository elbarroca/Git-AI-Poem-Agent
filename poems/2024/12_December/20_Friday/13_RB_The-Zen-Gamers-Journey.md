# The Zen Gamer's Journey

> *Get your zen on, then flex that coin—🎮🏯*

**1.** 🕊️ Mindful steps, one level at a time,


**2.** The path to wealth, a quest to find.


**3.** In the pixelated world, I grind,


**4.** 💰 Gold coins, my zen treasure, I've mined.


**5.** With each boss battle, I rise,


**6.** Unlocking secrets, old souls' wise advice.


**7.** 🎮 Gaming life, a mindful art,


**8.** When I play, my spirit's free, heart by heart.
