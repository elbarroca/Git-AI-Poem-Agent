# Millennial Tea Party

> *Tokyo's tea techie trend, low-key lit AF. 🍵🤖️*

**1.** In the heart of Tokyo's tech-savvy streets, 🌃


**2.** Where matcha lattes meet mindless tweets,


**3.** Modern life's chaos, a digital mess,


**4.** Yet, in the Zen garden, find mindfulness. 🍃


**5.** Amidst the noise, a calm retreat,


**6.** The ancient art of slowing down, a sweet feat.


**7.** Gen Z's balance, a mindful dance,


**8.** Finding peace in the modern-day trance. 🕊️
