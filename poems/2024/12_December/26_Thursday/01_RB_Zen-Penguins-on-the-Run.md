# Zen Penguins on the Run

> *This poem's a trip, like a penguin's icy dip, laundering stacks on a Zen path. 🧊💸*

**1.** 🐧 Penguins waddling, an ice-cold crew,


**2.** Tax evasion, laundering too.


**3.** Traveling the world, a mindful journey,


**4.** Seeking treasures, not just money.


**5.** In a Zen state, they glide with grace,


**6.** Mastering life's race, at their own pace.


**7.** Global adventures, they'll never flee,


**8.** Exploring wonders, so cool to see.
