# Title: Banana Iceberg Blues

> *🐧🐒 Crypto chasers, flexing in the metaverse, low-key lit!*

**1.** 🐒 Swinging from the trees, chasing digital keys,


**2.** 🐧 Waddle through the ice, seeking the crypto prize.


**3.** 💰 Money moves, a dance of wealth and fame,


**4.** Where freedom's just a game, and coins bear our name.


**5.** In the wild, we thrive, a chaotic symphony,


**6.** Navigating life's maze, seeking harmony.


**7.** A world of crypto-jungle, a Gen Z dream,


**8.** Where fortune's iceberg, just a swipe-screen stream.
