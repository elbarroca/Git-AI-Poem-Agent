# Jungle Economy

> *🐒💰 Tax evasion tea is chef's kiss but make it monkey business.*

**1.** In the concrete jungle, a monkey's business thrives,


**2.** Where wealth is freedom, a tax-evading drive.


**3.** Monkeys swing through trees, cash in hand, 🐒


**4.** Money laundering, a game they understand.


**5.** Traveling far, in search of greener lands, 🌍


**6.** Souls enriched, in a world of fiscal sands.


**7.** 🦍 Chaos masters, in a financial trance,


**8.** Navigating the system with a mischievous dance.
