# Monkey Mind, Money, and Zen

> *Reject humanity, return to monke*

**1.** Money makes the world go round, but it's just a tool.


**2.** 🐒 Swinging from branch to branch, I seek inner peace.


**3.** In the chaos, I find stillness, a Zen moment.


**4.** 🍵 The path to freedom is a mindful journey.


**5.** Monkeys, masters of mischief, teach us to play.


**6.** With each swing, a lesson, life's a jungle gym.


**7.** Wealth is more than coins; it's the soul's quest.


**8.** Let's find our freedom, a monkey's paradise.
