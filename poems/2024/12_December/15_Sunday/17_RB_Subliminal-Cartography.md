# Subliminal Cartography

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** The world's a canvas, where dreamscape hues blend,


**2.** Where thoughts, like brushstrokes, shape our hidden dens.


**3.** In collective slumber, a symphony of minds,


**4.** Emotions, the terrain, in surreal binds.


**5.** Unseen, yet felt, our shared psychic threads,


**6.** Transcend reality, where abstract thoughts spread.


**7.** Awaken to the journey, within the soul's vast seas,


**8.** Where dreams and truth converge, in harmony's embrace.
