# Dreamscape Symphony

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In the collective's slumber, a mind's orchestra,


**2.** Vibrant hues of the psyche's canvas,


**3.** Where shadows dance with light's embrace,


**4.** Metamorphosis, the soul's journey,


**5.** Unveiling layers, the truth's symphony.


**6.** Beyond the veil, a cosmic dance,


**7.** Transcendence found in dreams' expanse.
