# Penguin's Global Journey

> *Squad goals: penguin edition*

**1.** Waddling wonders, a flightless flock, üêß


**2.** The ice-cold crew, adventure unlocked.


**3.** From Antarctica to the world's great sights,


**4.** A travel tale, take flight.


**5.** With tuxedo charm, they roam and explore,


**6.** Seeking new lands, ever more.


**7.** In 2024, let's follow their lead,


**8.** And discover our own unique creed.
