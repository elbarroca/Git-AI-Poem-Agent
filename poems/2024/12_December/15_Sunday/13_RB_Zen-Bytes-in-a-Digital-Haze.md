# Zen Bytes in a Digital Haze

> *Vibes so good they transcend reality âœ¨*

**1.** Scrolling through screens, a daily scroll's trance,ðŸ§˜


**2.** Mindful swipes, the newsfeed's trance dance.


**3.** Tweeting thoughts, a meme's birthright,


**4.** Online Zen, a digital insight.


**5.** Haiku vibes, a modern twist,


**6.** Mindful breaks, from the FOMO mist.


**7.** In 2024, we tap and swipe,


**8.** Finding peace in a world that's swipe-swipe.
