# Quantum Dream

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** Vibrant hues of timeless mind,


**2.** Reality's threads, a tapestry entwined.


**3.** Sensory echoes, the unseen, we feel,


**4.** Beyond the veil, where truth is revealed.


**5.** In lucid dreams, consciousness expands,


**6.** Unveiling secrets, a cosmic dance.


**7.** Transcendence, where time's flow bends,


**8.** Infinite reflections, a kaleidoscope of 'what could have been'.
