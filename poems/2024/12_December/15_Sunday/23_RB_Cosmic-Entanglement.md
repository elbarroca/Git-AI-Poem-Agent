# Cosmic Entanglement

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** Beyond the quantum veil, a dream unfurls,


**2.** Where stars dance with the cosmos, entwined in surreal swirls.


**3.** Through superposed eyes, the universe bends,


**4.** Where reality's fabric weaves an infinite blend.


**5.** Senses entwine, sight hears the cosmic hum,


**6.** In this entangled realm, we are never truly numb.


**7.** As one with the universe, our dreams intertwine,


**8.** Transcending the physical, we're all quantum-aligned.
