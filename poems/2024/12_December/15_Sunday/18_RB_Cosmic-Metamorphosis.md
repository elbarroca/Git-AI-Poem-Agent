# Cosmic Metamorphosis

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In the heart of the cosmos, a spark ignites,


**2.** Unseen, it sculpts new worlds, a silent artist.


**3.** Senses merge, taste the colours of a distant star,


**4.** Emotions, like tides, sculpt our inner lands.


**5.** Through metamorphic veins, a journey begins,


**6.** Unravel the soul's tapestry, its threads divine,


**7.** All beings, a symphony, in harmony we rise,


**8.** Transformed, we find oneness in the infinite skies.
