# Infinite Unconscious

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In the heart of time, a cosmic dance,


**2.** Where moments blend, a kaleidoscopic trance.


**3.** The collective mind, a canvas of dreams,


**4.** Infinite hues, reality's seams.


**5.** Unseen threads, a tapestry of fate,


**6.** Beyond the senses, timeless and innate.


**7.** A universe within, the soul's pure light,


**8.** Eternal echoes, in every insight.
