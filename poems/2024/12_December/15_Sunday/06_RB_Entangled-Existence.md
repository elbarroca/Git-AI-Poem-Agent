# Entangled Existence

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In quantum entanglement,


**2.** Time's tapestry weaves threads of being.


**3.** The collective unconscious, a symphony,


**4.** Where senses blend, an echo's resonance.


**5.** In superposition, the present dances,


**6.** Past and future, a kaleidoscope's glance.


**7.** Transcendence found in shared consciousness,


**8.** The essence of reality, an entangled glance.
