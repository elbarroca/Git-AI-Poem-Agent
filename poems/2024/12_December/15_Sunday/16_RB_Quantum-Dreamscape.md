# Quantum Dreamscape

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In the quantum haze, where dreams entwine,


**2.** A clock's tick-tock echoes in the mind's eye.


**3.** Superposed reality, a surreal sight,


**4.** Entangled time, a dance without light.


**5.** Senses merge, the soul's symphony sings,


**6.** Unveiling truth, where matter's essence springs.
