# Interwoven Cosmos

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** The cosmic loom weaves threads of stardust,


**2.** Where galaxies dance, a tapestry of change,


**3.** Senses entwine, beyond the touch of time,


**4.** Sound of silence, the universe's chime.


**5.** In metamorphosis, consciousness evolves,


**6.** Questions of existence, the mind's eye solves,


**7.** Beyond the known, the truth unfolds.
