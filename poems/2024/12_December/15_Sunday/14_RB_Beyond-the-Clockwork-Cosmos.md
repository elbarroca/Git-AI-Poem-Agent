# Beyond the Clockwork Cosmos

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** Through the lens of eternity,


**2.** Time's fabric unravels, revealing cosmic threads,


**3.** Where seconds are stitches, binding galaxies' breath,


**4.** In a tapestry of existence, woven with life's threads.


**5.** Beyond the clockwork, a symphony of being,


**6.** Each note, a world, vibrating in harmony,


**7.** Where the universe sings its timeless melody.
