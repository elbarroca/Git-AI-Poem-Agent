# Ephemeral Impressions

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** As time's canvas unfurls, existence paints,


**2.** Perceiving self, a kaleidoscope of mind,


**3.** In abstract realms, consciousness entwined.


**4.** Through senses, emotions flow, an untamed sea,


**5.** Where thoughts like mountains rise, then fade,


**6.** Ethereal, fleeting, yet profoundly real.
