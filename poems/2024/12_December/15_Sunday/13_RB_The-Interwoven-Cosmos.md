# The Interwoven Cosmos

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In stardust's embrace, we dream,


**2.** Where shadows dance with conscious streams.


**3.** Unseen threads of collective mind,


**4.** In surreal realms, truths we find.


**5.** Beyond sight, a symphony,


**6.** Uniting worlds, you and me.


**7.** In cosmic rhythm, we're entwined,


**8.** Transcending time, a timeless bind.
