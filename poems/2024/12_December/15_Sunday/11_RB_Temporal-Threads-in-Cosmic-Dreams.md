# Temporal Threads in Cosmic Dreams

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In time's fabric, existence weaves a cosmic dance,


**2.** Where dreams, like stars, connect in surreal expanse.


**3.** Vibrant hues of reality blend,


**4.** In cosmic harmony, the soul ascends.


**5.** Perception bends, a kaleidoscope of being,


**6.** Where past, present, future, as one, sing.


**7.** Through dreams, we glimpse eternity's embrace,


**8.** Transcending time, in cosmic interconnected space.
