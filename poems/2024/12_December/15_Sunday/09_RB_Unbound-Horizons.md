# Unbound Horizons

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In the vast expanse, a grain of sand,


**2.** Where endless possibilities, unfurled,


**3.** Beyond the senses, a symphony,


**4.** Of thoughts, where questions, dance, unbound.


**5.** Reality's fabric, a canvas, alive,


**6.** Consciousness, the brush, strokes unknown,


**7.** In the void, a spark, the self ignites,


**8.** Infinite, the journey, beyond mind's sight.
