# Unveiling the Abstract Canvas

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** Vast horizons, a symphony of colors,


**2.** Where mind's eye paints ethereal dreams.


**3.** Touch the intangible, hear the silence roar,


**4.** In this realm, emotions weave the seams.


**5.** Beyond the tangible, a quest unfolds,


**6.** What is real? A question, ever-bold.


**7.** In consciousness, a canvas, grand and free,


**8.** The self, a masterpiece, yet to be.
