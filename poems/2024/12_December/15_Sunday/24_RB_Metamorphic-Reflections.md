# Metamorphic Reflections

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In time's mirror, a shifting kaleidoscope,


**2.** Vibrant hues of being, a cosmic dance,


**3.** Sound echoes through existence, a symphony,


**4.** Touching the untouchable, beyond senses' reach.


**5.** Unraveling the eternal, each moment's mystery,


**6.** In metamorphic rhythm, reality transforms,


**7.** Emerging, a new self, from consciousness' chrysalis,


**8.** Awakening to infinite, in timeless transcendence.
