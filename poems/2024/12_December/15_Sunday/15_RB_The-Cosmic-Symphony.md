# The Cosmic Symphony

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** Echoes of ancient dreams, a symphony of stars,


**2.** Vast emotions, mountains and valleys, cosmic scars.


**3.** Scent of eternity, in the breeze, a whisper's touch,


**4.** Taste the rainbow's tears, in every raindrop's clutch.


**5.** Unconscious minds, a collective pulse, beats in time,


**6.** Human tapestry, woven threads, an eternal chime.


**7.** Interconnected, we dance in harmony, as one,


**8.** With the universe's breath, our journey's just begun.
