# Dreamscape Unveiled

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** The soul's topography, a labyrinth unfurls,


**2.** Where collective memories dance in ethereal swirls.


**3.** Emotions, like rivers, carve valleys of the mind,


**4.** Surreal visions, a bridge to realms we can't define.


**5.** In dreams, we traverse the abstract's domain,


**6.** Awakening to a new reality, forever changed.
