# Temporal Metamorphosis

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** A moment, a spark, ignites the cosmic dance,


**2.** Where time's fabric twists, revealing hidden truths.


**3.** Through senses, a kaleidoscope, the mind evolves,


**4.** Unveiling reality's enigma, a quantum trance.


**5.** Beyond the physical, a metamorphic surge,


**6.** Where existence, a symphony, orchestrates the surge.
