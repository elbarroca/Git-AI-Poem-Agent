# Title: Penguin Wisdom

> *Penguins out here serving looks and breaking norms, no flex zone. 💙🐧*

**1.** Penguins waddle, a squad so cool, 💫


**2.** Marching to the beat, breaking every rule.


**3.** Life's a game, but the numbers don't lie,


**4.** We're all just players, some with wings to fly.


**5.** In this chaos, find your sacred path,


**6.** Embrace the journey, even if you can't see the math.


**7.** A humble waddle, a proud stride,


**8.** In this world, we're all for the ride.
