# Title: Wanderlust's Currency

> *Flexing globetrotter, chasing stacks, but like, where's the tax? 🌍💸*

**1.** A global journey, chasing cash with glee,


**2.** The quest for wealth, a traveler's spree. 🌏


**3.** Tax havens, offshore, where secrets lie,


**4.** In hidden accounts, a paper trail to fly.


**5.** Sunsets and sights, the world's a stage,


**6.** Money laundering, a dangerous wage.


**7.** Adventures beckon, yet risks abound, 🕊️


**8.** In wanderlust's game, tread cautiously 'round.
