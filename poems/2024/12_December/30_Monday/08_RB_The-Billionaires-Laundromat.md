# The Billionaire's Laundromat

> *Cashin' out like a CEO, flexin' 💰🤝, no taxin' needed!*

**1.** 💎 Roll up to the casino, a high-roller's paradise


**2.** Tax haven, where secrets hide, 🧽 money's washed clean


**3.** 💸 Luxury's my lifestyle, no need for a cheap disguise


**4.** In this game, I'm the boss, while the feds stay blind


**5.** My empire's built on cash, a pyramid of paper


**6.** But beware the dirty trick, when fortunes take a dip


**7.** Laundering, a risky art, a criminal's sweet chart


**8.** A gamble, a grand heist, 💣 or a life in bliss
