# Zen Laundromat

> *Laundering tea ceremony vibes, low-key 🍵💸*

**1.** 🧠 Mindfulness in the world of laundering,


**2.** Where dirty money cleansed, a peaceful art.


**3.** Tax evasion, a game of shadows,


**4.** But zen masters teach, "Flow like water." 💧


**5.** 🪙  A quiet mind, a hidden treasure,


**6.** Money's power, a double-edged sword.


**7.** Zen Laundromat, where balance thrives,


**8.** A mindful money dance, with purpose alive.
