# The Millennial's Odyssey

> *Jet-setter flexing 🌍💰, but who's counting?*

**1.** Passport stamped, I'm off to see the world 🌎


**2.** Money in my pocket, but is it truly wealth?


**3.** Wanderlust whispers, "Explore the unknown."


**4.** Yet, freedom's price tag leaves me torn.


**5.** In search of wonder, I roam the earth,


**6.** Navigating life's maze, finding my worth.


**7.** Beyond the cash, a journey within,


**8.** Seeking meaning, where should I begin?
