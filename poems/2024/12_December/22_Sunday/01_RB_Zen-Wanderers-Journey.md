# Zen Wanderer's Journey

> *Chillin' with the Zen vibes, wanderlust is my type of flex. 🌅🎎*

**1.** 🌠 In the city's rush, I pause for a breath,


**2.** 🌏 The world's my stage, I step out to explore.


**3.** 🧘‍♀️ Mindful steps, I wander with intent,


**4.** 🗾 Where ancient temples meet the modern trend.


**5.** ✈️ From Tokyo's glow to Kyoto's charm,


**6.** 🌅 I seek the sunrise, a daily alarm.


**7.** 🍵 Tea ceremonies, a taste of peace,


**8.** 🌍 My journey's path, where Zen meets wanderlust's release.
