# Lunar Luck and Legal Loopholes

> *💰😱 This poem be flexin' dirty money moves, low-key shady like a Scorpio moon.*

**1.** 💲Stashing cash, evading taxes, a fiscal dance,


**2.** Money laundering, the dirty moves of chance.


**3.** 🌕Zodiac signs align, cosmic forces at play,


**4.** Destiny's wheel spins, guiding our way.


**5.** 💸Wealth's pursuit, a quest for freedom's embrace,


**6.** Yet, the soul seeks truth, beyond the money chase.


**7.** 🐉In a world of cycles, a dragon's tale untold,


**8.** Ancient wisdom meets modern gold.
