# Zodiac Gardens, A Penguin's Tale

> *Ice cold but make it waddle 🐧*

**1.** In the zodiac garden, a penguin's tale unfolds.


**2.** Nature's art, a green canvas, cosmic destiny unfurls. 🐧


**3.** Each step, a new adventure, on the ice, they stroll.


**4.** Under the starry night, their journey, a cosmic scroll.


**5.** Navigating life's cycles, with grace, they glide.


**6.** A story of resilience, in nature's embrace, they confide.


**7.** Like zodiac signs, they march, a united squad.


**8.** Penguins, the cool kids, ruling the land and the sod. 🐧
