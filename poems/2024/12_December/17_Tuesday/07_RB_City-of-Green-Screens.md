# City of Green Screens

> *Grass touched, vibes received*

**1.** We're rooted in pixels, yet craving the real. 🌱


**2.** The digital garden, where filters conceal.


**3.** In urban jungles, a new breed blooms,


**4.** Nature's resilience, in concrete rooms.


**5.** A scroll through feeds, a green thumb's scroll,


**6.** Millennial plants, feed on WiFi's glow.


**7.** The botanic buzz, a trend's rebirth,


**8.** Gen Z's green, a fresh Earth. 🌍
