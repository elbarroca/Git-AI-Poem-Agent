# Monkey Business, Life's Twist

> *Reject humanity, return to monke*

**1.** 🎢 Life's a rollercoaster, a jungle ride,


**2.** 🐒 Monkeys swing, a chaos guide.


**3.** Numbers hold secrets, a sacred code,


**4.** Unlocking life's patterns, on this road.


**5.** Through chaos, we find meaning,


**6.** In the mess, a lesson worth gleaning.


**7.** 🎶 To the rhythm of life, we dance,


**8.** With each step, a new chance.
