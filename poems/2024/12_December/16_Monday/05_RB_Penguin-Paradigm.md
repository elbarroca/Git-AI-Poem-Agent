# Penguin Paradigm

> *Numbers don't lie, but they do throw shade 🔢*

**1.** Waddling to the beat, the ice-cold crew 🐧


**2.** Five-zero-five, a lucky number, we're true.


**3.** Navigating life's ocean, our path's in sync,


**4.** Sacred geometry, we're never on the brink.


**5.** The world's our playground, we glide with grace,


**6.** In perfect formation, we find our place.


**7.** Penguin power, we own the night, 🔢


**8.** Our tribe's together, always in flight.
