# Cosmic Crypto Quest

> *This poem is low-key crypto-whispering 🔮🎮*

**1.** In the year of the Metal Rabbit, we're all gamers,


**2.** Navigating chaos, seeking hidden treasures. 🐰


**3.** From the stars to the blockchain, a quest awaits,


**4.** Where crypto's the key, and coins are like fates.


**5.** 🎮 Unlocking new levels, our journey's just begun,


**6.** 🚀 To the moon and beyond, the race is never done.


**7.** When the market's a maze, and life's a grand game,


**8.** You gotta trust your instincts, and stay in the frame.
