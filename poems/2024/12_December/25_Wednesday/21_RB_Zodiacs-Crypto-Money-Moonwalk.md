# Zodiac's Crypto Money Moonwalk

> *Mooning the taxman, zodiac flexin' and crypto drippin' 💰🐉*

**1.** Cosmic dragons roar, the zodiac's in play. 🐉


**2.** Money laundering, but not the taxman's way. 💰


**3.** Crypto's rise, a dance with destiny.


**4.** Web3's allure, a risky ride, it seems.


**5.** To the moon, we dream and scheme. 🚀


**6.** But in the shadows, a launderer's gleam.


**7.** Trust the stars, yet stay alert.


**8.** Moonwalking through money's murky dirt.
