# Penguins of Wall Street

> *🐧 Flexing their wealth, these peng-guys are thriving, iceberg vibes on point! 💸*

**1.** Marching in black and white, a squad of Arctic brokers,


**2.** Navigating icebergs, dodging seals, making trades.


**3.** In the cold depths, 🐧 a dollar's warmth is sought,


**4.** Where each step is a venture, and survival's bought.


**5.** From snow-capped peaks to Wall Street's concrete,


**6.** Wealth's pursuit, like a waddle, takes its beat.


**7.** With freedom's wings, they soar above the flock,


**8.** Leaving footprints, a legacy, in the frosted stock.
