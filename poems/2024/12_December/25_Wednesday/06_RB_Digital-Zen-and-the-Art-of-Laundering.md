# Digital Zen and the Art of Laundering

> *AI's got the tech tea, 💻 but who's doing the money laundry? 🧹 #GenZWhispers*

**1.** In the digital realm, AI dreams unfold,


**2.** Tech's rapid pace, yet we're so controlled. 💻


**3.** Money laundering, a dark cyber-art,


**4.** Schemes woven tight, leaving no loose part.


**5.** Mindful moments, a Zen break we need,


**6.** Like tea in a storm, to calm and to lead. 🍵


**7.** Laundering tax evasion, a modern-day sin,


**8.** The price of progress, a high-tech spin.
