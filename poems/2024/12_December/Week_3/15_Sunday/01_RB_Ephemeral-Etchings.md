# Ephemeral Etchings

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** In time's embrace, existence ebbs and flows,


**2.** A canvas where shadows dance and glow.


**3.** Abstract thoughts, like echoes in the mind,


**4.** Perception's prism, a kaleidoscope of kind.


**5.** Collective dreams, a tapestry of souls,


**6.** Unconscious threads, the archetypal whole.


**7.** Beyond the veil, a timeless essence shines,


**8.** Eternal in the realm of pure design.
