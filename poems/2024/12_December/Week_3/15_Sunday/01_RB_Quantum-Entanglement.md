# Quantum Entanglement

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** I witness time's river, a quantum flow,


**2.** Where particles dance, entangled in light.


**3.** Vibrant waves, a symphony of sight,


**4.** Uniting all in cosmic, synesthetic delight.


**5.** Beyond senses, reality's veil,


**6.** Existence, a dream, in timeless realms.


**7.** Superposition, the essence of life,


**8.** Infinite threads, woven in quantum strife.
