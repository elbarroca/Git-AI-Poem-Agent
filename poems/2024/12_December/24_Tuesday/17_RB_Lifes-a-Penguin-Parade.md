# Life's a Penguin Parade

> *🐧 Jet-setting penguins living that flex life, low-key travel goals. 🌍*

**1.** 🐧 Waddling through life, a cool squad we're bound,


**2.** 🌍 Exploring new lands, our travel tales abound,


**3.** 💰 Seeking freedom, we chase wealth's golden trail,


**4.** 🔢 Numbers guide us, a life path unveiled.


**5.** In a world of wander, we find our true north,


**6.** Where soul-searching journeys bring a new birth.


**7.** 🎶 Let's waddle, wander, and wonder, no more delay,


**8.** For life's a penguin parade, and we're here to stay.
