# Zen and the Art of Monkey Business

> *Zen monkey business, a mindful flex, no big deal. 🐒🎋*

**1.** In the urban jungle, a mindful monkey swings,


**2.** Balancing the chaos with Zen vibes, so it sings. 🌳


**3.** A scroll through the feed, a mindful pause,


**4.** Breathing deep, in the social media maelstrom.


**5.** 🐒 With a playful grin, the monkey asks, "Why so serious?"


**6.** Finding peace in the chaos, a modern-day lotus.


**7.** Embracing the monkey mind, 2024's new vibe,


**8.** Monk-keys to enlightenment, no more strive.
