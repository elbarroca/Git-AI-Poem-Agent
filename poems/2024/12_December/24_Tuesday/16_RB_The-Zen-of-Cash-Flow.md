# The Zen of Cash Flow

> *Money moves, Zen grooves, 💸🗻 slaying the cash flow game.*

**1.** The dollar signs dance, a money-making trance.


**2.** 💹


**3.** Finding freedom in the flow, the soul's glow.


**4.** Meditate and manifest, the Zen quest.


**5.** 🙏


**6.** Market moves, but the mind stays at rest.


**7.** Balance the books, a mindful look.


**8.** Wealth and wisdom, the ultimate bliss.
