# Title: Zodiac's Laundromat: A Monkey's Tale

> *🐒 Money laundering, but make it zodiac chic. 😎*

**1.** 🐲 The Monkey swings through tax havens,


**2.** 🤣 Hiding cash, evading the law's gaze,


**3.** 💰 In a game of hide-and-seek, money's laundered,


**4.** 🌊 Cosmic cycles, a dance of chance and fate.


**5.** 🐒 In the jungle of finance, chaos reigns,


**6.** 🌟 Where destiny's a roulette, spinning wild,


**7.** 🎭 Modern life's a satire, a funny charade,


**8.** 🧘🏽‍♀️ Yet we seek balance, in this crazy trade.
