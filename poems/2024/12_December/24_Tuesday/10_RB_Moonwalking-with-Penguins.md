# Moonwalking with Penguins

> *Penguins know how to crypto-hustle, low-key 🐧💸*

**1.** Laundering cash, I'm feeling so ice-cold.


**2.** Penguins huddle, whispering blockchain code. 🐧


**3.** In the crypto cave, where secrets unfold,


**4.** Digital footprints, our hidden gold.


**5.** Tax evasion, a risky road.


**6.** But we glide through, with a collective soul.


**7.** To the moon and back, we hold our own,


**8.** A squad united, never alone. 🚀
