# The Great Wealth Caper

> *ðŸ’¼ Who needs a maze when money's a game? ðŸ¤‘*

**1.** Chasing paper, but the bank's a maze,


**2.** Money moves, yet the rich stay caged. ðŸ’°


**3.** A crypto dream, or just a Ponzi scheme?


**4.** Soul-searching in a world that's mean.


**5.** The quest for wealth, a modern-day gold rush,


**6.** But freedom's cost? Just a market hunch. ðŸ¦‹


**7.** Gen Z's game, to break the mold,


**8.** Where wealth's a tool, not a soul to hold.
