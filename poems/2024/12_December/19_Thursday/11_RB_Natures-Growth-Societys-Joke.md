# Nature's Growth, Society's Joke

> *Grass touched, vibes received*

**1.** A seedling sprouts, life's journey begins, ðŸŒ±


**2.** Yet screens distract, where do we begin?


**3.** Nature's beauty, a remedy for stress,


**4.** Our minds, though, crave likes and instant success.


**5.** The digital age, a double-edged sword,


**6.** Disconnecting us from nature's reward.


**7.** Time to unplug, smell the roses' scent,


**8.** And find our peace in nature's silent tent.
