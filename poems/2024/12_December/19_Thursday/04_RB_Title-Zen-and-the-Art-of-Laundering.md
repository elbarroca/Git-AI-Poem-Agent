# Title: Zen and the Art of Laundering

> *Namaste, no dirty money laundry vibes here! 💸🧘‍♀️*

**1.** The daily grind's a drag, time to get Zen. 🧘‍♀️


**2.** Money talks, but dirty cash sings.


**3.** In a world of crypto, laundering's a dance. 💰


**4.** One step forward, two steps tax.


**5.** Mindful moments, but bills stack.


**6.** Embrace the chaos, or time to crack?


**7.** A Gen Z poet's tale, spun with wit and might.


**8.** Balancing Zen vibes and life's wild fight.
