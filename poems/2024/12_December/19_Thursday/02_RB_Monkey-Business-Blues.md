# Monkey Business Blues

> *🙈💰 This poem's a vibe, a monkey's wild ride through the bank!*

**1.** Laundering cash, monkeys on a spree.


**2.** 💰 Money flows, but not so freely.


**3.** Tax evasion, a risky game.


**4.** 🐒 In the jungle, they swing and claim.


**5.** One day, the law comes knocking.


**6.** A lesson learned, no more mocking.


**7.** The price of freedom, a hefty fine.


**8.** Monkeys learn, but stay just fine.
