# Jungle Tax Evasion Squad

> *Penguins and monkeys, flexing hard, but that laundering tea ain't smart. 🐧🐒*

**1.** Penguins in black and white, ice-cool, slick and bright. 🐧


**2.** Monkeys swing and dance, jungle rhythm, tax evasion trance.


**3.** In the wild, they're free, no worries of the IRS.


**4.** But in suits, they scheme, money laundering with finesse. 💰


**5.** Laundering cash, like snowflakes melting, never to be traced.


**6.** A financial dance, where monkeys and penguins embrace.


**7.** Squadron of tax evaders, living life unchained.


**8.** Monkeys and penguins unite, where chaos and coolness reign.
