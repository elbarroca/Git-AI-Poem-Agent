# Penguin's Financial Dive

> *Penguins, but make it money laundering. 😎💰*

**1.** In the frozen world, penguins thrive,


**2.** Waddling through life with a stylish glide.


**3.** Laundering money, an icy breeze, 💰


**4.** Schemes like snowflakes, hard to seize.


**5.** Tax evasion, a slippery slope,


**6.** Yet they march on, with no hope.


**7.** Penguins hustle, never give up, 🐧


**8.** Living proof that crime doesn't pay, just slurp.
