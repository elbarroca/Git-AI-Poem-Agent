# Flight of the Penguin

> *Ice cold but make it waddle 🐧*

**1.** Marching to the beat of our own drum,


**2.** In tuxedo suits, we're never glum. 🐧


**3.** Wealth and freedom, a modern dance,


**4.** Navigate life's chaos, no second chance.


**5.** Seeking purpose, we dive deep,


**6.** Souls enriched, no need to weep.


**7.** Waddling through satire, we persist,


**8.** Cool as ice, our squad's a fist. 💪
