# Crypto Penguins in Zen

> *This poem is sus, but it's giving crypto-zen vibes.🧘‍♀️🐧*

**1.** 🧘‍♀️ A mindful approach to crypto wealth,


**2.** In a world of tokens, a Zen master's health.


**3.** 🚀 To the moon, they say, but with penguins in tow,


**4.** Marching in unison, an icy flow.


**5.** Web3's a journey, a quest for truth,


**6.** Penguin power, a loyal crypto youth.


**7.** 🐧 Cool and calm, they waddle through the night,


**8.** In a blockchain world, their wits are bright.
