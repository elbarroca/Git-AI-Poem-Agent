# The Penguin Parade

> *These penguins 🐧 are money laundering low-key, like a crypto whale 🐳.*

**1.** Marching in black and white, a waddle with style 🐧


**2.** Tax haven secrets, hidden in plain sight


**3.** Iceberg adventures, a chill squad so fly


**4.** While banks launder cash, they dive deep and cry


**5.** In a world of schemes, they waddle with grace


**6.** The truth's buried under, in a financial race


**7.** Cold-blooded crime, but penguins stay cool


**8.** The money trail's long, yet they follow the rules.
