# Moonstruck Mindfulness

> *This crypto haiku's got me like, sheeeesh, so deep! ðŸ§ ðŸ’°*

**1.** Web3's a wild ride, where crypto coins dance,


**2.** To the moon and back, a digital trance. ðŸŒ™


**3.** In the chaos, Zen's a calming breeze,


**4.** A mindful moment, a breath of ease.


**5.** FOMO's fire, but self-care's the key,


**6.** For balance in this crypto symphony. ðŸŽ¶


**7.** Embrace the ride, but anchor your soul,


**8.** In ancient wisdom, stay grounded and whole.
