# The Crypto Traveler's Trail

> *This poem's crypto flight is a whole vibe, like a moonlit Fortnite ride. 🌙🚀*

**1.** In the metaverse, a rocket takes flight,


**2.** 🚀 Aiming for the moon, with crypto's might.


**3.** From money laundering's dark, hidden lair,


**4.** A digital fortune, tax-free and rare.


**5.** I wander the world, with crypto's key,


**6.** Unlocking wonders, a new destiny. 🌍


**7.** A journey through code, a trail so grand,


**8.** To the moon and back, I conquer the land.
