# Title: Digital Zen and the Art of Numbers

> *Matrix vibes, but make it meta! 🧠🔢🇯🇵*

**1.** In the matrix of screens, we scroll and swipe,🕸️


**2.** An endless feed, a modern-day plight.


**3.** Meditate on the zero, the void, the start,


**4.** From nothingness, a digital spark.


**5.** Life's a code, a sequence of ones and twos,


**6.** The universe's rhythm, a sacred groove.


**7.** In the chaos, find balance, breathe and pause,


**8.** Zen in the binary, a mindful cause.
