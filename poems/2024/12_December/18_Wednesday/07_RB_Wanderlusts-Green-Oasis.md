# Wanderlust's Green Oasis

> *Passport stamps but make it poetic*

**1.** Nature's canvas, a masterpiece unfurled,


**2.** A modern world, where chaos is the norm. ðŸŒŽ


**3.** Wanderlust's compass, a travel-bug's quest,


**4.** In search of beauty, we find nature's best.


**5.** In a concrete jungle, a green oasis,


**6.** The digital age meets ancient traces.


**7.** Satire and satire, we navigate the mess,


**8.** Seeking peace, we find nature's bliss. ðŸŒ¿
