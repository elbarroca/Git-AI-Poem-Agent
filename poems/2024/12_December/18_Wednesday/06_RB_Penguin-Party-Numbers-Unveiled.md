**1.** One waddles, two waddles, a march of fluffy fun, 🐧


**2.** Three, four, five, they dive, the icy ocean's won.


**3.** Six and seven, a snowball fight, then chill in the sun.


**4.** Eight, nine, a huddle, warm vibes, everyone's one.


**5.** 🔢


**6.** A colony of cute, their numbers are profound,


**7.** Ten, a leader, steers the flock with a regal crown.


**8.** Eleven and twelve, a perfect pair, love's profound.
