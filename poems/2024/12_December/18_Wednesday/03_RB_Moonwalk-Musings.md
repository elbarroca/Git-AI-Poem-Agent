# Moonwalk Musings

> *To the moon but make it philosophical ðŸš€*

**1.** In the crypto craze, we dance with the stars, ðŸŒŸ


**2.** To the moon and back, a journey so bizarre.


**3.** Memes and tweets, the new-age news,


**4.** Where trends are king, and truth's a noose.


**5.** From Bitcoin to Dogecoin, we're all in this race,


**6.** Navigating scams and hacks with grace.


**7.** Web3's wild ride, a tech-filled maze,


**8.** Where Gen Z dreams of greener days.
