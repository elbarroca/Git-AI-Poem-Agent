# Frosty Footprints to Fortune

> *🐧 This poem is 100% that entrepreneur life, slayin' with humility! 💰*

**1.** Marching to the beat of a different drum, 🐧


**2.** Entrepreneurial penguins hustle with aplomb.


**3.** Manifesting wealth, the journey's so chill,


**4.** 888K month soon, no time to stand still.


**5.** In the icy trenches, success takes grit,


**6.** Yet humble hearts prevail, staying true to it.


**7.** Keep grinding, stay grounded, it's the key,


**8.** For the squad that hustles together, succeeds gracefully.
