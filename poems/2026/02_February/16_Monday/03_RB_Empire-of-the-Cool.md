# Empire of the Cool

> *Slaying like a penguin in Rome, flexing freedom, 💎🐧— a Gucci-clad gladiator!*

**1.** Gladiator in Gucci, the arena's my runway. 🏛️


**2.** Modern Rome's a meme, laughter's my sword. 🎭


**3.** Coins clinking, freedom's mine to buy. 💰


**4.** Penguin crew, waddling through the city's ice-cold nights. 🐧


**5.** In marble halls, I seek purpose, not just pay.


**6.** Swimming in the sea of souls, my chill squad.


**7.** Glitz and glamour, but peace is the real prize.


**8.** Cool kids rule, yet true wealth's within.
