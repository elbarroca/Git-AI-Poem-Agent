# Mid Lane Magic and Cosmic Connections

> *Spittin' fire verses, a dragon's got my back! 🐉🔥*

**1.** In League's arena, mid lane's my stage, where I wield magic and slay. 🎮


**2.** Dragon's roar echoes, my power source, a cosmic embrace. 🐉


**3.** Each game, a destiny's dance, where skill and luck intertwine.


**4.** Pentakills paint the canvas, a masterpiece, oh so divine.


**5.** Unleashing spells with precision, I dominate the rift.


**6.** Ancient zodiac signs guide me, a cosmic map, a subtle gift.


**7.** Mid diff? Nah, just my style, a unique flow, can't be replicated.


**8.** Conquering the enemy nexus, my journey's destination. ⚔️
