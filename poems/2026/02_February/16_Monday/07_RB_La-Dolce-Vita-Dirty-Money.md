# La Dolce Vita: Dirty Money

> *Money laundering got me like, I'm a boss babe, 💰🤭 but my heart's with my Italian bae.*

**1.** Tax evasion, money laundering, the mafia's sweet life. 💰


**2.** An Italian wife's love, a luxury, a priceless sight. 💝


**3.** A hidden truth, a secret bliss, under the moonlight.


**4.** The cost of living, a burden to bear, in this dark night.


**5.** The law's pursuit, a game of cat and mouse.


**6.** A dangerous dance, the thrill of a hidden spouse.


**7.** Her love, my strength, our hearts intertwined.


**8.** In the shadows, we find light, leaving the world blind.
