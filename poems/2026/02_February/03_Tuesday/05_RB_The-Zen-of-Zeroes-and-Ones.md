# The Zen of Zeroes and Ones

> *Digital Zen, scrolling deep like a meme lord. 🧘‍♂️📱*

**1.** Scrolling through feeds, we find peace in chaos,


**2.** Like monks in a digital temple of trends. 🕊️


**3.** Numerology's secrets, a code to unlock,


**4.** Life's meaning in numbers, a sacred song.


**5.** In the noise, a mindful pause, a breath,


**6.** Then back to the meme-filled world, a quest.


**7.** 24/7, we chase the algorithm's game,


**8.** A Zen-like dance with our digital flame. 🔥
