# Banana Billionaire Empire

> *🚀 Who needs a billionaire lifestyle when you've got a monkey squad? 😎*

**1.** 🚀 Launching rockets with my monkey crew,


**2.** From the treetops, we'll build a new view.


**3.** Luxury's a game, we play it well,


**4.** Swinging through the markets, a billionaire's swell.


**5.** In the concrete jungle, we thrive,


**6.** With wit and wisdom, our empires survive. 🐒


**7.** 🍌 Banana business, a Gen Z tale,


**8.** Where chaos meets class, and we never fail.
