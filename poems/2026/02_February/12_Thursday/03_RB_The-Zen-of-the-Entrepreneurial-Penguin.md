# The Zen of the Entrepreneurial Penguin 🐧

> *Entrepreneurial penguins serving Zen tea, low-key vibes 🐧🍵*

**1.** In the world of hustle, a mindful chill,


**2.** The Zen of the grind, a peaceful skill.


**3.** Penguins know the art of focused work,


**4.** Ice-cool squad, no time to shirk.


**5.** Entrepreneur's spirit, a determined spark,


**6.** With Zen philosophy, a powerful mark.


**7.** Marching to success, with purpose and poise,


**8.** Hustle and mindfulness, Gen Z's choice.
