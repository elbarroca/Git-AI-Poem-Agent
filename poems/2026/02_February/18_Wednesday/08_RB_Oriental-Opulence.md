# Oriental Opulence

> *Ancient tales, new wealth goals, 🧧 slay like a Zen boss!*

**1.** 🎑 Seeking fortune, ancient tales guide my path,


**2.** Manifesting wealth, I envision my future bright,


**3.** In the hustle, I find Zen moments,


**4.** 🍵 Embracing the flow, I thrive in the now.


**5.** Modern China, a dragon's roar,


**6.** In the digital age, I code my fate,


**7.** Ancient wisdom, my inner compass,


**8.** 🎏 888, my lucky charm, brings abundance alive.
