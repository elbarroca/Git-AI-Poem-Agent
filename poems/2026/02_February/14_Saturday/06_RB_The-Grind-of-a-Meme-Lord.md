# The Grind of a Meme Lord

> *Flexing entrepreneurial skills, grinding the LOL way, 💰🎮*

**1.** No cap, I'm the king of the jungle, mid lane pentakills, no diff.


**2.** Grinding the 9-5, side hustle's a must, chasing that cheese 🧀.


**3.** Laundering memes, rinsing trends, rinsing and repeat.


**4.** My content's bussin', but the IRS be trippin', evading taxes, I'm drippin'.


**5.** In the zone, dodging bans, I'm the tax evasion boss.


**6.** Views on loop, my bank balance is a fraud.


**7.** Keep it fresh, fr fr, my memes be drippin', success is inevitable. 💰


**8.** In the game of life, I'm here to stay, laundering laughter, my way.
