# Billionaire's Laundry

> *Money moves, but these billionaires be 💰 flexing like a TikTok trend.*

**1.** Laundering money, like washing sins away, 💰


**2.** The rich get richer, while the rest stay at bay.


**3.** Private jets and yachts, a billionaire's play,


**4.** Tax evasion's just a game they love to slay.


**5.** Stacking cash, they rise above the rest, 💎


**6.** In a world of luxury, they're truly blessed.


**7.** Living lavish, a life most desire,


**8.** Empire builders, with money as their empire.
