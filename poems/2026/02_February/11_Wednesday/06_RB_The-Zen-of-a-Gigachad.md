# The Zen of a Gigachad

> *Flexing my alpha energy, China vibes on fleek! 🧝‍♀️🥢*

**1.** I walk the path less trodden, a rebel with a cause,


**2.** Breaking rules, shaping fate, my alpha journey, a blaze.


**3.** In the modern world, chaos reigns, yet I stand tall.


**4.** 🎭 In satire, I find my throne, a witty jester's call.


**5.** From ancient China, a dragon's roar, 🏮 power unfurled,


**6.** Modern might meets ancient sight, a fusion unfurled.


**7.** In the clash of old and new, I find my stride,


**8.** A Gen Z poet, my verse, my pride.
