# Roman Riches, Gen Z Style

> *Simping for the Roman empire, but make it humble flex 🏛️💰*

**1.** I dream of wealth like 888, a fortune to manifest,


**2.** Not just money, but abundance, a life truly blessed. 🌟


**3.** In the footsteps of the Romans, I walk with pride,


**4.** But stay humble, for arrogance is a heavy ride.


**5.** Luxury surrounds, yet I keep my roots intact,


**6.** Finding balance, a Gen Z act.


**7.** With ancient wisdom and modern vibes, I strive,


**8.** Living life lavish, but never deprived. 🍷
