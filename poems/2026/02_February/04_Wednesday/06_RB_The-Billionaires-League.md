# The Billionaire's League

> *Gotta flex that diamond 💎 life, ballin' hard like a LoL pro! 😎*

**1.** I'm livin' large, stackin' paper like a boss, 💎


**2.** Gotta flex, can't deny, I'm on top of my game.


**3.** In the League, mid lane's my domain, ⚔️


**4.** Pentakills and pings, I rise to fame.


**5.** Memes and trends, I set the pace,


**6.** No cap, I'm manifesting 888 in my space. 💰


**7.** From zero to hero, I'm never broke,


**8.** A Gen Z billionaire, fr fr, no joke.
