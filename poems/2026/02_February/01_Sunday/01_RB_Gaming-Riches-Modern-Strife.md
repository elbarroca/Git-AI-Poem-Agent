# Gaming Riches, Modern Strife

> *This poem's got me like, Money laundering who? 💰👀*

**1.** Level up, unlock new quests, a journey to wealth. 🎮


**2.** 888K month, a dream, yet I strive to manifest.


**3.** In a world of crypto, taxes and laundering, we dance.


**4.** Modern life's chaos, a game of hide and seek. 🎭


**5.** Money moves, like a boss, but the IRS lurks.


**6.** Laundering schemes, like a maze, for the filthy rich.


**7.** Tax evasion, a risky game, but some still try.


**8.** In this digital age, I quest for fortune, and survive.
