# Zen and the Art of 888K Manifestation

> *Manifesting that bread, Zen-style! 🧘‍♀️💸*

**1.** I'm manifesting 888K, a Zen path to financial bliss.


**2.** 🎯 Abundance flows like a river, and I'm ready to fish.


**3.** Tax evasion and money laundering, a tempting dance.


**4.** But mindful choices lead to true wealth, a Zen romance.


**5.** 🍵 I brew patience, my fortune's tea.


**6.** Avoiding risks, my money's safe with me.


**7.** Vibes attract vibes, so I keep it positive and free.


**8.** 888 wealth, here I come, manifesting destiny. 💰
