# Zen in the Mid Lane

> *Genshin Impact x LoL crossover, but make it Zen 🧘‍♀️🎮*

**1.** League of Legends, a digital Zen garden,


**2.** Where mid lane battles are a daily grind.


**3.** No cap, I'm farming minions, mind at peace, 🌊


**4.** While my squad spams pings, I keep my cool.


**5.** A pentakill quest, the ultimate thrill, 🗡️


**6.** One shot, one kill, precision is key.


**7.** Vibes bussin' hard, the win screen's bliss,


**8.** Mindful mastery, no tilt, just zen bliss. 🧘‍♀️
