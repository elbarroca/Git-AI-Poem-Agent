# Cash Flow Confessions

> *Spitting bars on stacks, low-key flexing 🤑🎤*

**1.** I'm a Gen Z poet, spinning rhymes like gold. 💰


**2.** Manifesting riches, my spirit can't be sold.


**3.** Money laundering, a game I'll never play,


**4.** But my words will pay the price, I'll find a way.


**5.** From taxes to treats, I'm not one to evade,


**6.** Instead, I'll create, my own wealth cascade. 🎯


**7.** 888K soon, a vision so clear,


**8.** Poetic justice, my success is near.
