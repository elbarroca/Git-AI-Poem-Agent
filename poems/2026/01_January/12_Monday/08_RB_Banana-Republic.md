# Banana Republic

> *Monkeys swinging through history, they got that Roman Empire drip 💎🐒*

**1.** Monkeys rule the jungle, swinging through the vines. 🌴


**2.** A Roman feast, but they'd rather eat grapes and dine. 🍇


**3.** The empire's luxury, a distant dream,


**4.** While monkeys' reality is a chaotic scene.


**5.** In 2024, a modern twist,


**6.** They seek a digital empire, a blockchain list.


**7.** To conquer the web, a new type of Rome,


**8.** Monkeys unite, no more feeling alone. 🕊️
