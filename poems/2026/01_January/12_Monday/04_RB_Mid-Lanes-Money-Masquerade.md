# Mid Lane's Money Masquerade

> *Gotta flex that pentakill skill, laundering in style 💰🎮*

**1.** In the rift, mid lane's my domain,


**2.** Where pentakills and CS reign.


**3.** 🎮 A battle of skill and gold,


**4.** Where secrets of wealth unfold.


**5.** Laundering money, a dangerous game,


**6.** Tax evasion, a risky fame.


**7.** 💰But in the heat of the fight,


**8.** We conquer all with might.
