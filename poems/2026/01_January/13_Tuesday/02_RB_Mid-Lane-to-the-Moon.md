# Mid Lane to the Moon

> *Spittin' fire rhymes, the climb to Challenger starts now! 🔥🎮*

**1.** Manifesting wins, a journey to the top lane


**2.** Mid diff, no tilt, just a path to fame


**3.** 🎮 Click, cast, and conquer, the enemy's slain


**4.** Abundance flows, like a fountain in May


**5.** Dominating the rift, pentakills all day


**6.** The gold stacks high, an 888K display


**7.** A champ's dream, the mid lane's might


**8.** League's grind, a wealth quest, in sight. 💎
