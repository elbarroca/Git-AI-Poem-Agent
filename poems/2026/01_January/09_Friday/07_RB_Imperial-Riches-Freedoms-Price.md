# Imperial Riches, Freedom's Price

> *Emperors flexing wealth, but I'm like, Naw, I'm good, fam. 💰🤚*

**1.** Emperors ruled with might, but I'd rather be me,


**2.** A Gen Z poet, with a modern-day decree. 🖋️


**3.** Luxury's not just marble and gold,


**4.** It's freedom to be bold.


**5.** Coin-clinking freedom, yet I still yearn,


**6.** To fill the void, lessons to learn. 💫


**7.** Beyond the riches, my soul seeks peace,


**8.** In a world where wealth isn't a piece.
