# Imperial Penguin Gaming

> *Gaming penguins in Rome, a flex so lit, even the emperors would stan. 🎮🐧*

**1.** I'm in the Colosseum, gaming with penguins 🐧,


**2.** Rome's ancient glory, an empire of fun.


**3.** Marching to the beat, our waddling crew,


**4.** Questing for fish, our hunger never done.


**5.** Leveling up, we slide into the night,


**6.** In this frosty realm, we find our might.


**7.** Gliding on ice, we're an unstoppable force,


**8.** Gaming, an art, we conquer the source.
