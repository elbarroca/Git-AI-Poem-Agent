# Golden Vibes, Unlocked Dreams

> *Lowkey, this poem's drippin' in wealth goals, no flex. 💰🔥*

**1.** Manifesting riches, 888's my lucky charm,


**2.** No cap, fr fr, I'm a money magnet, charmed. 💰


**3.** Blonde strands, like sunshine, my crown,


**4.** Self-care's my vibe, bussin' glow, so profound. ✨


**5.** In 2024, I'm breaking free,


**6.** Unleashing wealth, a soul set free.


**7.** Confidence is my new bestie,


**8.** Living life, unbothered, blissfully.
