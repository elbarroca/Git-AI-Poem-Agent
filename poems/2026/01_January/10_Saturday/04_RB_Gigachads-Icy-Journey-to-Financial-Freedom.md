# Gigachad's Icy Journey to Financial Freedom

> *Flexin' on a budget, this poem's a whole mood. 🐧💸*

**1.** A 2025 vision, I'm on a mission,


**2.** Navigating life, no cap, just precision.


**3.** Laundering cash, avoiding tax, 💰


**4.** Hustle like a penguin, an ice-cool snack.


**5.** Fr fr, this Gen Z's got no time to waste,


**6.** Vibing with success, no cap, just pure taste.


**7.** Let's buss it in the new year, 🌊


**8.** Elevating vibes, no fear, no tear.
