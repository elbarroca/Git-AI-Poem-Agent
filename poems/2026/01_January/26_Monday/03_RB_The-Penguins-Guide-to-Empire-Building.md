# The Penguin's Guide to Empire Building

> *Billionaire penguin flexing in Rome, serving ancient tea real hard. 🐧💵*

**1.** From Arctic home to Rome's Colosseum, 🐧


**2.** I'm a billionaire penguin, my story's awesome.


**3.** Travel the world, no need to be coy,


**4.** In my jet, I'm a fast and fancy boy.


**5.** The Roman Empire's a dream I envision,


**6.** Building my empire, a modern-day Caesar's mission.


**7.** Luxury life, but not without a cause,


**8.** I waddle through ice and heat, leaving my paws.
