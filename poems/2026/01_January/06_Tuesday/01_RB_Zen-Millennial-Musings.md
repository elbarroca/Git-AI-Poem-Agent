# Zen Millennial Musings

> *Aesthetic af, this poem's a whole vibe, low-key 🍵👀*

**1.** In a world of trends and TikTok fame,


**2.** I seek peace in a Zen frame. 🍵


**3.** Vibes so bussin', no cap, it's true,


**4.** Finding balance is a meme, but I'm not blue.


**5.** My mind's a garden, thoughts like flowers,


**6.** Watered by memes, blooming for hours.


**7.** No fr fr, just mindful moments,


**8.** A Gen Z sage, unbothered by torment.
