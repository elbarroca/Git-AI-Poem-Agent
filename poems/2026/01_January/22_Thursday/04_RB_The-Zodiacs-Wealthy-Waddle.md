# The Zodiac's Wealthy Waddle

> *Penguins on a grind, hustling for that 888K vibe, 🐧💸.*

**1.** 🐧 A penguin posse, cool and collected,


**2.** 888K dreams, they're not defected.


**3.** 🎯 Manifesting wealth, a cosmic goal,


**4.** Zodiac signs, the stars' control.


**5.** 🐲 In the year of the dragon, luck unfurls,


**6.** Penguins march to their own beat, no herds.


**7.** An ice-cold empire, success in sight,


**8.** Manifesting wealth, a penguin's might.
