# The Penguin Parade

> *Penguin squad goals, they'd slay on TikTok. 💫🐧*

**1.** Penguins waddle with grace, a cool squad in black and white.


**2.** Social media stars, they tweet without a fight. 🎤


**3.** In a world of chaos, they stay calm, a chill vibe.


**4.** While we scroll, they glide, their march a perfect stride.


**5.** Climate's changing, ice melting, their home at risk. 🌍


**6.** But these penguins march on, their resilience, a powerful twist.


**7.** They teach us to waddle through life, with style and a smile.


**8.** A squad to admire, they're here to stay a while.
