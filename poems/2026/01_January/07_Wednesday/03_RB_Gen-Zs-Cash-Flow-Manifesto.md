# Gen Z's Cash Flow Manifesto

> *Sliding into that money laundering business like a smooth criminal. 💸👀*

**1.** The hustle is real, no cap, 888K soon,


**2.** Money moves, I'm a pro, no cartoon.


**3.** Stacking bills, a modern art,


**4.** Navigating taxes, a skill, no part-time.


**5.** Laundering schemes, a twisted game,


**6.** Bussin' hard, but not the same. 💰


**7.** Gen Z's grind, a fresh vibe,


**8.** Manifest wealth, no more strive.
