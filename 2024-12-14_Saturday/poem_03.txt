Title: Digital Dreams

In the city's neon glow, a million pixels light,
Where screens reflect in eyes, a digital delight.

Code, a new language, weaves the future's tapestry,
Transforming dreams into reality's symphony.

As fingers dance on keys, ideas take flight,
Unleashing innovation, a virtual might.
