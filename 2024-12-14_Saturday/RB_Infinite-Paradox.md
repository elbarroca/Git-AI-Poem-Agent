# Infinite Paradox

Time's tapestry, a quantum dance,
Where particles weave existence's trance,
A symphony of numbers, a cosmic ballet,
Each moment, a kaleidoscope of infinite array.

Perception's prism bends reality's flow,
Mind's eye, a portal to the unknown,
Where thoughts, like photons, intertwine,
In a quantum realm, consciousness defines.

Fragmented selves, a psychological maze,
In unity, find solace in time's haze,
As nature's rhythm beats, a timeless pulse,
Eternal questions, the universe's pulse.

In this abstract verse, I strive to capture,
The essence of being, a timeless rapture.
