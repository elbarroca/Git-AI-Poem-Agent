# *Quantum Catharsis*

> *An abstract exploration through consciousness and time*

**1.** Through the kaleidoscope, I see


**2.** Shattered fragments, a prism's symphony.


**3.** Touching the intangible, tasting the truth,


**4.** Beyond reality's cocoon, a new birth.


**5.** Where consciousness dances, a metamorphic bloom,


**6.** In dreams, the universe whispers her secrets.


**7.** Unveiling the quantum, the surreal, the divine,


**8.** I awaken, transformed, beyond time.
