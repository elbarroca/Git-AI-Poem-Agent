# 🤖 Git-AI Poem Agent: Bussin' Bars While Git Stays Lit fr fr

_"AI's in the studio, dropping heat,
Twenty-eight commits make the day complete.
Not about the grind or GitHub flex,
Just vibing with poetry, what comes next?

Automation's the key, no cap fr fr,
Let the bot cook while we're living care-free.
Each poem hits different, that's the tea,
In this creative space, we're all meant to be."_

## 🎯 The Real Talk

Git-AI Poem Agent isn't your average contribution farmer - it's a whole mood. This bot:
- 📝 Drops 28 unique poems daily using Cohere's AI
- 🔄 Auto-commits throughout the day (starting 8 AM)
- 🎨 Creates dedicated folders for each day's poetry collection
- 🤝 Proves AI can keep it fresh without the copy-paste nonsense

### Why Though? 
Because we're tired of:
- GitHub contribution graphs being the whole personality
- Manual content creation when robots can do it better
- Boring repos without creative vibes
- Taking ourselves too seriously in tech

## 🛠 How This Bad Boy Works

### The Daily Routine
1. **Wake Up Call (8 AM)**
   - Bot starts its daily grind
   - Creates a fresh folder for the day's content

2. **The Poetry Flow**
   - Generates one poem every 16 minutes
   - Each poem gets its own markdown file
   - Auto-commits and pushes to keep it real

3. **Quality Control**
   - Handles errors like a pro
   - Keeps track of progress
   - Makes sure we hit that 28-poem target

## 💫 Features That Hit Different

- **Smart Scheduling**: Starts at 8 AM daily
- **Auto Recovery**: Picks up where it left off if interrupted
- **Folder Management**: Keeps everything organized by date
- **Git Integration**: Handles commits and pushes automatically
- **Error Handling**: Keeps it pushing even when things get weird
