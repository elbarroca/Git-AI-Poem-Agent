# 🤖 Git-AI Poem Agent: Automating Creativity, One Commit at a Time  

_"Skibidi dop dop yes yes bro,  
Git commits flow like TikTok glow.  
Boomers gasp at this Gen Z grind,  
Poems and code, perfectly combined.  

Green squares don’t mean you’re elite,  
It’s vibes and passion that make you sweet.  
Commit counts? Just flex, don’t stress,  
Poetry in Git is how we impress."_

## 🎉 What Is This All About?  

Welcome to **Git-AI Poem Agent**, where code meets creativity and Gen Z vibes rule the day. Forget about proving your worth with boring contribution graphs—this project automates the creation of **28 daily poetic commits** while dunking on outdated metrics.  

What’s the tea?  
- **Daily Poems**: Coere’s free API generates fresh, funny, or deep poems.  
- **Automatic Commits**: These poems get committed to GitHub throughout the day.  
- **Creative Experiment**: We’re testing how well AI can stay unique (and not copy-paste itself like a bad TikTok trend).  

The real message: **Don’t judge devs by their GitHub profiles.** Just like your Skibidi Toilet dance doesn’t define your career potential, green squares don’t mean you’re the GOAT.

## 📜 How It Works  

This project is as simple as posting a meme to Twitter:  

1. **Fetch the Vibes (Poems)**  
   - The script (`poetry_commit.py`) hits Coere’s API to generate poems based on themes.  

2. **Commit Like a Beast**  
   - Each poem becomes a commit—spread across the day like your favorite posts on BeReal.  

3. **Archive the Magic**  
   - All poems live in `poems/`, a forever vault of your AI-generated bars.

### 🗂️ Repository Structure  

- **`poems/`**: Daily poetry files, saved like snaps in your streak.  
- **`themes.json`**: Daily themes, because random poems are cringe.  
- **`poetry_commit.py`**: The Python wizard that makes it all happen.  
- **`config.json`**: Stores your Coere API key (aka your creative juice).  
- **`daily_commit.yml`**: A GitHub Actions workflow that keeps the grind automated.
