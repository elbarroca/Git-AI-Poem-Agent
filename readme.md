Hey there, fellow code gardener! 🌱 Tired of that empty GitHub contribution graph looking like a drought season? Let's get your garden growing with some automated green patches! Because sometimes, the best kind of green is the one that grows itself. 😉

## 🪴 What's This All Growing About?

This project is your automated gardening tool for GitHub. It's like having a sprinkler system for your contribution graph - set it up once, and watch your garden grow! Each day, it plants a new seed (commit) that grows into beautiful ASCII art, one line at a time.

## 🌱 How This Garden Grows

The growing process is as natural as photosynthesis:

1. **Plant Your Seeds**: Drop ASCII art files in the `ascii_images/` folder
2. **Set Up Your Sprinkler System**: Our automation waters your garden daily (with 10 commits for maximum growth 🌿)
3. **Watch It Bloom**: Your ASCII art grows line by line in `output.txt`

### 🏡 Garden Structure

- **`ascii_images/`**: This folder contains each ASCII image as a text file (like `image1.txt`, `image2.txt`, etc.).
- **`output.txt`**: The file where each line of ASCII art is slowly revealed each day.
- **`progress.txt`**: Tracks which image and line we’re currently on. It’s our little progress marker.
- **`daily_update.sh`**: The magic script that does the work every day, adding a line, committing it, and keeping track of progress.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repo**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Configure Git**: 
   - Set up your Git username and email
   - Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens)
   - Add the token as a repository secret named `GH_TOKEN` (Settings > Secrets > Actions > New repository secret)
3. **Automate the Script**:
   - For local automation, set up a cron job
   - For GitHub automation, configure GitHub Actions using the included `daily_commit.yml` file (it will use your secret token)
4. **Watch the Art Grow**: Sit back and watch as each ASCII art image builds up day by day, filling your contribution graph with unique updates!

## ⚙️ Customization

Feel free to add your own ASCII images to the `ascii_images/` folder. Just keep each ASCII image in its own file and split it by lines—one line per row. The script will take care of the rest. And if you want to tweak how often it commits, adjust the cron job or GitHub Actions settings to your preference.

## 📅 Why This Matters (or Doesn’t)

This project exists because, honestly, green squares don’t tell the whole story. Committing every day doesn’t necessarily mean you’re more productive or a better developer. Sometimes, we just like seeing a fully filled contribution graph—it’s visually satisfying, and that’s okay! Think of this project as a small reminder that while it’s cool to show off your GitHub activity, what matters most is the quality and passion behind your work, not the number of commits.

## ✌️ License

This project is open-source under the MIT license. Feel free to fork, customize, and make it your own!

---

Enjoy the ASCII art, and may your profile stay green (even if it doesn’t mean anything)! 😎
