# Unfolding Infinity's Paradox

In the quantum haze, a timeless dance,
Where seconds stretch like infinite threads,
Existence, a kaleidoscope's glance,
Refracting reality's fractured sheds.

Through synaptic storms, thoughts cascade,
Entangled minds, a cosmic ballet,
Perception's prism, the soul's charade,
In the heart of time's intricate play.

Fragmented, yet whole, the self-aware,
Infinity's echo, a silent roar,
In the dark matter's embrace, beware,
The universe's breath, a timeless shore.
